Rank is your formal standing in organized and semi-organized structures: priesthood, magical accreditation, military, administration, nobility, guilds, criminal networks, etc.

## Rank Levels

| Level | Title Examples | Description |
|-------|----------------|-------------|
| 1 | Initiate, Apprentice, Corporal, Bachelor, Gang Member | Entry level, learning the ropes |
| 2 | Regular, Journeyman, Sergeant, Master's Degree, Trusted Member | Full member, independent work |
| 3 | Specialist, High Journeyman, Lieutenant, Aspirant, Pack Leader | Recognized expertise, some authority |
| 4 | Leader, Master, Captain, Professor, Gang Leader | Commands others, significant influence |
| 5 | Commander, Guildmaster, General, Rector, Network Boss | Top of hierarchy, major power |

## Organization Size Limits

Ranks are limited by organizational capability. A guildmaster of a small guild counts as Rank 3-4, not 5. A "general" without an army isn't Rank 5.

| Organization Scope | Max Rank |
|--------------------|----------|
| Local (street gang, village guild) | 2-3 |
| Regional (city guild, barony) | 3-4 |
| Major (kingdom-wide, major religion) | 4-5 |

## Earning and Losing Rank

- **Earned through:** Service, exams, promotion, inheritance, purchase (money/favors, not XP)
- **Requirements:** Many organizations require appropriate skill levels for higher ranks
- **No XP value:** Ranks don't cost XP and don't increase attributes
- **Loss:** Misconduct, treason, incompetence, abandoning duties, or organizational collapse

## Rank and Downtime Quality

Your rank provides typical access to [[Downtime Quality|Downtime Quality]] levels:

| Rank | Typical Quality Access |
|------|------------------------|
| 1-2 | Adequate (2) without extra cost |
| 3 | Good (3) from organizational support |
| 4-5 | Excellent (4) or better through connections |

Specific benefits depend on the organization (see [[8.1 Organizations]]).
