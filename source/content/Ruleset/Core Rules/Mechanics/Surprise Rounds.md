**Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.

**Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.

**Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.
