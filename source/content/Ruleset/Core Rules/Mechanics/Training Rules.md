Learning and training require spending **downtime** to convert **XP** into **skills, perks, or spells**.

## Base Training Time

**Base time:** 1 Day per XP at Adequate (Quality 2) conditions.

A **Day** of training equals **4 Shifts** (~10 hours). You cannot train effectively for more than 4 Shifts per Day.

## Training Time by Quality

| Quality         | Time per XP | Example                         |
| --------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| 0 - Nonexistent | 10 Days     | Self-taught, no materials       |
| 1 - Poor        | 2 Days      | Bad manual, distracted mentor   |
| 2 - Adequate    | 1 Day       | Competent teacher OR manual     |
| 3 - Good        | 5 Shifts    | Skilled teacher AND materials   |
| 4 - Excellent   | 2.5 Shifts  | Master teacher, full facilities |
| 5 - Exceptional | 1 Shift     | Legendary master, perfect setup |

## Quality Requirements by Tier

The higher the tier of a skill or perk, the greater the requirements. What counts as "Good" for Tier 2 may be "Poor" for Tier 4.

| Tier | Minimum for Adequate | Good requires |
|------|---------------------|---------------|
| 1-2 | Any instruction or manual | Skilled teacher or quality manual |
| 3 | Trained instructor or full manual | Expert teacher AND reference materials |
| 4 | Expert instructor or rare texts | Master teacher AND specialized facility |
| 5 | Master instructor | Legendary master AND perfect conditions |

## GM Notes

This rule is situational and designed for campaigns that utilize downtime. Track it loosely in favor of players.

If players completed a heist or fought a significant battle, you may allow them to level up a skill or gain a perk directly. You can allow XP debt or grant perks with #Instant trait in debt.

This system creates narrative hooks: fighting an ancient lich to gain his spellbook, attending a bankruptcy auction where a fabled sword manual is sold, or seeking out legendary masters.
