# Rarity

Rarity represents how available knowledge, techniques, and equipment are in the world. Corresponds to skill/domain levels and organizational access.

> **NOTE:** Rarity system is not meant for v0.4 - planned for later versions.

## Rarity Tiers

| Rarity | Skill Level | Availability | Guild Rank |
|--------|-------------|--------------|------------|
| **#Common** | 0-1 | Widely available, legal, public access | Apprentice |
| **#Uncommon** | 2 | Specialized practitioners, larger towns | Journeyman |
| **#Rare** | 3 | Major cities, connections/payment required | Advanced Journeyman |
| **#Epic** | 4 | Guild masters, formal recognition needed | Master |
| **#Legendary** | 5 | Grandmasters, exceptional circumstances | Grandmaster |

Rarity is contextual - connections, wealth, and regional differences affect availability. See [[8.1 Organizations]] for how organizations are limited by their scope.
