# 9. Movement and Distance

Exceed uses meters as the standard unit of measurement for all game calculations. Whether you play on a hex grid, square grid, or use theater-of-the-mind rules, all distance values in the game represent meters.

**Character Space:** The area a character occupies, represented by a token on a grid-less map, or a square/hex on a grid.

## Speed

**Movement Speed** (in-game referenced as just "Speed"):


`Speed = 5 + Agility + (Running ÷ 2, rounded down) + Bonuses - Penalties`

## Movement Actions

All movement actions cost 1 AP (except Run, which requires a prior Stride).
