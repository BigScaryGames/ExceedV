## Damage Thresholds

**Half-Health:** First time you fall below 50% of your Health from a hit during combat, roll 2d10 on the [[Consequences Table|Consequence Table]]. If this attack dropped you to 0 or below, roll only for that.

**0 Health:** **Each** time your Health reaches or goes below 0 from a lethal hit, roll 1d100 on the [[Consequences Table|Consequence Table]], and mark 1 wound (reducing max Health and Stamina until fully recovered).

## Getting Below 0 HP and Death

When below 0 Health you need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC of your highest treatment DC wound to stay conscious at the end of each of your turns.

- Each **lethal hit** you take in this state makes you roll on the consequence table.
- Each **non-lethal hit** you take in this state makes you roll Endure against the hit to stay conscious.

When below **negative full Health** - you fall unconscious. Unless the attack was nonlethal you also need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC to stay alive at the end of each of your turns.

**Death:** If your wounds would exceed max wounds, you die.

## Special Cases

- **Non-lethal attacks:** If the attack forcing the consequence was non-lethal, roll 2d10 instead of 1d100.
- **Persistent DoT:** If the damage forcing the consequence was persistent DoT - don't roll for the consequence.
