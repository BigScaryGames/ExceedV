## Description
You and your team have a short window to negotiate with Animals to prevent combat.

One day you noticed that cats and dogs love you more then others. Unless on a guarding duty they never bark at you or try to harm you, horses generally don't throw you off, even wild animals don't attack you instantly on sight, and may allow you to walk away.
