## Description
You are an expert in corruption.

A silken shirt, a silver sword hilt that isn't an old heirloom, the attitude. They don't need to rub their hands for you to sense corruption. You sense it when it's in front of you, and know when to offer people to participate in it. You know the words and hints to suggest it in the most vague forms. How do you use that knowledge is a different question.
