## Description
Enhance your ability to perceive magic.

Arcane sight had its moment of glory among nobles and mages alike upon its invention two centuries ago. People passed the quite painful ritual to gain the knowledge on whom to challenge and whom to avoid.
The boom ended overnight with the invention of #Illusion enchantments mimicking the Spellcraft Tier. [[Mislieading Rings]] are mass produced ever since.
