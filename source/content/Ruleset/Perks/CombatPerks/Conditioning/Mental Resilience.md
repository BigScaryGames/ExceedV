## Description
Fortify your mind through mental discipline; at mastery develop formidable mental defenses.

Through meditation, facing your fears, or controlled exposure to mind-affecting magic, you build walls around your consciousness. Mental exercises strengthen your will like physical training strengthens muscle. Whether through monastic meditation techniques, exposure to minor enchantments, or simply surviving traumatic experiences, you learn to compartmentalize and protect your thoughts. At the peak of this training, your mind becomes a fortress, resistant to intrusion and manipulation.
