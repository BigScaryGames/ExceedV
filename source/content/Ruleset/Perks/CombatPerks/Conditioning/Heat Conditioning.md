## Description
Adapt to extreme heat through exposure; at mastery thrive in scorching environments.

Through forge work, desert survival, or deliberate heat exposure training, your body has adapted to function in temperatures that would prostrate others. You've learned to regulate your temperature, conserve moisture, and maintain clarity of thought when heat threatens to overwhelm. Whether from working beside blast furnaces, crossing sun-baked wastelands, or systematic sauna training, your tolerance for heat has been forged like steel. At mastery, you move through infernal heat as comfortably as others enjoy a warm summer day.
