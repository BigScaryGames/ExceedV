# 4.2 Medical Treatment and Wound Consequences

Getting into a fight is a dangerous endeavor, and you haven't emerged from it unscathed.

## Core Wound System

1. Roll the [Consequence Roll]
2. Write down the lasting consequence on your character sheet and mark 1 wound
3. Remove the mark from the wound and the consequence after the rest period. See [[Recovery Rules||Recovery Time by Quality]] for conditions based rest time modification.
4. GM can lower the effects of the consequence at certain times during the rest. E.g. Head 3 to Head 2 after halfway through recovery, or Limb 2 to Limb 1 etc.
5. If re-injured GM decides the severity level to reopen it

## Consequence Roll

`[Consequence Roll] = 1d100 - (Remaining Wounds × 10)`

If the attack forcing the consequence was a **Critical Hit**, add +10 to the consequence roll.

## Terms

**Treatment DC:** 11 + Double of sum of all wounds severity

**Limb Determination:** When a consequence affects a limb, roll 1d4 - on 1-2 it's an arm, on 3-4 it's a leg. Left to right.
