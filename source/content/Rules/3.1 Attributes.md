# 3.1 Attributes

## The Eight Attributes

### Mental Attributes
- **Perception** - Awareness, noticing details, sensing danger
- **Will** - Mental fortitude, discipline, magical capacity
- **Charisma** - Force of personality, leadership, presence
- **Wit** - Quick thinking, problem-solving, magical control
### Physical Attributes
- **Might** - Raw strength, damage output
- **Endurance** - Stamina, toughness, resilience
- **Agility** - Speed, reflexes, dodging ability
- **Dexterity** - Precision, fine motor control, accuracy

## Attribute Progression

**Starting Value:** 0 in all attributes and can range from -3 to +5. 
Having an attribute below -3 indicates a character that is no longer able to exceed and likely needs medical attention or replacement. 

**Thresholds:** Accumulate points from skills and perks to increase attribute tiers.

| Points    | -30 | -20 | -10 | 0   | 10  | 30  | 60  | 100 | 150 |
| --------- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attribute | -3  | -2  | -1  | 0   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 5   |

**How It Works:** Attributes progress indirectly. Skills and perks grant attribute points equal to XP spent. When purchasing a skill or perk with multiple attribute options (e.g., Tracking: Perception/Endurance), you choose which attribute receives the XP.
