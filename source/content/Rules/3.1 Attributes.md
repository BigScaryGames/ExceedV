# 3.1 Attributes

## The Eight Attributes

### Mental Attributes
- **Perception** - Awareness, noticing details, sensing danger
- **Will** - Mental fortitude, discipline, magical capacity
- **Charisma** - Force of personality, leadership, presence
- **Wit** - Quick thinking, problem-solving, magical control

### Physical Attributes
- **Might** - Raw strength, damage output
- **Endurance** - Stamina, toughness, resilience
- **Agility** - Speed, reflexes, dodging ability
- **Dexterity** - Precision, fine motor control, accuracy

## Attribute Progression

**Starting Value:** 0 in all attributes

**Thresholds:** Accumulate points from skills and perks to increase attribute tiers

| Points | Attribute Level |
|--------|-----------------|
| 10 | 1 |
| 30 | 2 |
| 60 | 3 |
| 100 | 4 |
| 150 | 5 (Maximum) |

**How It Works:** Attributes progress indirectly. Skills and perks grant attribute points equal to XP spent. When purchasing a skill or perk with multiple attribute options (e.g., Tracking: Perception/Endurance), you choose which attribute receives the XP.
