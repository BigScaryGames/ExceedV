## Critical Results
Doubles on the kept dice (2 chosen dice for advantage, the 2 lowest for disadvantage, or the 2 dice for normal roll) modify outcomes:
- **Success + Doubles:** Critical Success
- **Failure + Doubles:** Critical Failure (if applicable)

## Critical Hits
Critically succeeding against an enemy with an attack or spell roll creates a critical hit or critical defense.
By default - i.e. without modifications from perks and spells - only critical hits provide with extra effects - in this case extra damage.
Perks in the game allow to add effects and activate abilities on own critical defense or enemy's critical failures.

As of MS5 critical hits double damage dice.
In later iterations weapons will be provided critical modifiers using CritX (where X is the extra damage per damage die).
