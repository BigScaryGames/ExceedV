To roll for a consequence fist ask 3 questions and modify the consequence roll.
1. Was it a non-lethal strike?
2. Was in a crit?
3. Was it a DoT

Consequence Roll = 1d100 - (Remaining Wounds × 10).

1. Non-lethal - roll 1d20 on the consequence table instead of normal consequence roll.
2. If it was crit - Add +10 to the roll.
3. If it was DoT - count the consequence as a cosmetic injury.
