# Spellcraft

Spellcraft is a Domain (skill following special progression rules). It progresses as the player learns spells and spellcraft perks.

Each level of Spellcraft unlocks the ability to learn and cast spells of the appropriate tier.

## Spell Costs by Tier

| Tier | Basic Price | Advanced Price | XP to Next Tier |
|------|-------------|----------------|-----------------|
| 0 | 1 | 3 | - |
| 1 | 3 | 5 | 10 |
| 2 | 5 | 7 | +20 |
| 3 | 7 | 10 | +30 |
| 4 | 10 | 15 | +40 |
| 5 | 15 | 25 | +50 |

## Learning Spells

Spells contribute to appropriate attributes AND to Spellcraft at the same time.

Some spells have Basic/Advanced variations. Advanced variations require extra XP investment - they usually lower the limit cost, make it team-wide, or modify it in other ways.

### Requirements

Learning a spell from a library or spellbook requires:
- Magical Theory or Theology skill ≥ spell tier
- A source from which to learn

Learning from a teacher bypasses skill requirements.

### Duration

As per [[9.2 Downtime and Training||Training]], learning a spell takes 1 unmodified day per XP spent.
