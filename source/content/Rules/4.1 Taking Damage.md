Players take damage as per [[3.3 HP And Wounds|Health and Wounds]] first depleting stamina, then depleting health. Players can reach negative HP with a value of Max Health not accounted for wounds.
## Getting Below 0 HP and Death

**Getting to 0 Health:** **Each** time your Health reaches or goes below 0, roll a [[Consequence Roll]] , and mark 1 wound.

When at or below 0 Health you need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC of your highest treatment DC wound to stay conscious at the start of each of your turns.

- Each **lethal hit** you take in this state makes you roll a [[Consequence Roll]].
- Each **non-lethal hit** you take in this state makes you roll Endure against the hit to stay conscious.

When below **negative full Health** - you fall unconscious without a check. Unless the attack was nonlethal you also need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC to stay alive at the end of each of your turns.

**Death:** If your wounds would exceed max wounds or reach negative HP due to a lethal attack, you die.
