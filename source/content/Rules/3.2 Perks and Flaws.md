# What Are Perks?
Perks represent specific training, experiences, conditions or specializations your character has undergone. They embody the "how" and "why" behind your character's capabilities.

Perks cost XP and represent investments in specific areas of expertise. When you take a perk, you typically gain attribute points equal to the XP spent (some perks are free and some are without an attribute). These attribute points bring selected attributes closer to their next threshold (positive or negative).

Most perks don't have levels, but some do. In that case each previous level overrides each next level, as per perk description. 

Example of overriding are:

Perks may have prerequisites (other perks, skills, or attributes) and provide mechanical benefits that reflect your character's specialized training.

## Perk Categories

- **Combat Perks**: Specialized combat techniques, weapon training, tactical abilities
- **Skill Perks**: Specialized applications of skills (though skill perks don't directly increase skill levels)
- **Spellcraft Perks**: Magical specializations and techniques

## How Perks Work

1. Spend Combat XP or Skill XP to purchase a perk
2. Choose which attribute receive the XP points (following the perk's specifications, if any)
3. The XP spent becomes attribute points that move the chosen attribute toward the next threshold
4. Example: Spend 5 XP on a combat perk, choose Might → Might gains 5 points toward +1 threshold

Perks follow the ability/effect system structure where abilities are active choices and effects are passive bonuses.

## Introduction to Flaws (to be integrated in 0.6)
Flaws are perks with a minus sign.

They represent personal, social and physical limitations that shape your character. Like perks, they follow the bottom-up philosophy: "Why are you disadvantaged in this area?"

Perhaps you are an alcoholic that reduces your perception or wit (not yet written might have other attributes), an egoist that reduces your will or charisma, or you were an adventurer before you got an arrow to the knee making you less agile. Flaws provide negative XP that can be spent on other perks, skills and spells. When you take a flaw, you assign its negative XP to decrease chosen attributes and give yourself the appropriate XP.

## How Flaws Work

1. Select a flaw and receive negative XP (e.g., -5, -10, -15 XP)
2. Choose which attribute receive the negative XP points (if there is a choice)
3. The negative XP moves the chosen attribute toward the previous threshold 
4. Example: Take a flaw worth -5 XP, choose Will. Will was at 3XP prior → Will loses 5 points and becomes -2, thus turning the stat into -1.

Flaws create mechanical effects beyond just attribute penalties (roleplay hooks, situational limitations).


## Voluntary vs. Involuntary Flaws

- **Voluntary Flaws**: Chosen during character creation for negative XP. They provide you with experience points to spend.
- **Involuntary Flaws**: Acquired through story events, GM decisions, or consequences. They might provide with XP points up to GM discretion.

Both affect attributes similarly, but only voluntary ones provide XP during character creation and involuntary ones are up to GM.
