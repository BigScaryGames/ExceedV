## Hit Points and Wounds System

### Base Health
All human characters start with:
- **2 Max Wounds**  
- **5+Endurance HP per Wound**

Armor provides Ablative HP, based on the number of wounds.
Ablative HP - Wounds * Armor Bonus.
### HP Calculation
HP is 

**Total HP = Max_Wounds × (5 + Armor Bonus+Endurance)+ExtraHP**
  - Stamina HP: First half (recovers quickly)
  - Health HP: Second half (real damage)
On the first Stamina HP depletion during combat and each time Current HP reaches or goes bellow 0 roll on [Consequences table] in [[3.3 Medical Treatment and Wound Consequences]]according to the table rules.

### Increasing Hit Points

#### Perk: ExtraHP (Endurance/Will)
- **Cost:** Max_Wounds * CP per HP
- **Consolidation:** Every 5 HP (change with race HP in later iterations) purchased consolidates, increasing Max_Wounds by 1.  The new wound operates like all other, i.e.  you gain full armor and endurance bonus like with existing wounds
- **Example:** Character with +2 Armor and 2 wounds has 4 extra HP
  - Current: 2 wounds × (7 HP + 2 HP) = 18 total HP  
  - After buying 1 more HP: 3 wounds × 7 HP = 21 total HP

### Progression Examples
- **Starting:** 2 wounds × 5 HP = 10 total HP (12 with armor 1)
- **+1 Wound (10 CP):** 3 wounds × 5 HP = 15 total HP (21 with armor 2)
- **+2 Wounds (20 CP):** 4 wounds × 5 HP = 20 total HP (32 with armor 3)
