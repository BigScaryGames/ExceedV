## When to Roll for Consequences

**Half-Health:** First time you fall below 50% of your Health during combat roll 2d10 on the Consequence Table, if the initiating attack was a critical - roll 2d10+10.

**0 Health:** **Each** time your Health reaches or goes bellow 0 roll 1d100 - (Remaining Wounds × 10) on the Consequences Table, Mark 1 wound (reducing max Health and Stamina until fully healed). 

### Getting below 0 HP
When below 0 Health you need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC of your highest treatment DC wound to stay conscious. Each hit you take in this state makes you roll on the consequence table. 
When below negative full Health - you fall unconscious and unless the attack was nonlethal you need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC each turn to stay alive.


**Special Circumstances:**
- **Non-lethal attacks:** Roll 2d10 instead of 1d100
- **Critical hit:** Add +10 to the consequence roll

## Treatment Definitions

## GM Notes

**Adjusting Results:**
- Players can reroll results using any available reroll abilities
- Consider character's armor, magical protections, and circumstances when applying consequences

**Treatment and Recovery:**
- **Emergency Treatment:** Treatment difficulty increases by +1 DC for every 10 minutes after the first minute of injury
- Some consequences are permanent and add to character story
- Most can be removed with skilled healing and monetary investment

**Remaining Wounds Modifier Examples:**
- **2 Remaining Wounds:** Roll d100-20 (maximum result 80)
- **5 Remaining Wounds:** Roll d100-50 (maximum result 50)
- This prevents worst outcomes for tough characters while maintaining tension
