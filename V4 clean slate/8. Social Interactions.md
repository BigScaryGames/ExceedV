Weather conduction negotiations, gathering gossips, conning someone of their hard earned money or talking your way out of getting jailed after social interactions follow a set of rules.

GM - using a randomiser or up to his interpretation of the situation comes with the initial level of attitude towards the PC/PCs. This is modified by their race, class (social), rank, etc.
The attitude ranges from -5(hostile nemesis/ can attack on site) to +5(fanatical love and adoration).



Players interact with NPCs normally, their actions and words affecting the attitude.

In cases players want to skim over the interactions or directly lead to an attitude change or request or offer something a check might be required.

# Actions

## Affect attitude.

Decide which skill you are going to use. You can use an appropriate social skills or like Negotiations, Manipulation, Gossiping, Leadership, Fast-talk (for first impression only), Gossip, Intimidation (usually efficient to lower the attitude), Streetwise or appropriate to the situation skill - like siting with a smith or Arcane Lore with a mage.

Roleplay the said interaction if possible. The target will either change the attitude or resist it with an opposing check. (i.e. GM might decide that your strategy is particularly effective or counterproductive.)

Roll said Skill + Charisma (or other stat, per GM allowance or request). The target opposes it with an appropriate roll (of GM's choice). 
## Detect falsehood 
When you try to detect usage of manipulation and lies you can roll RP+Manipulation or PR+WL whichever is higher.
This is a blind GM check, that will provide you with "Something seems off" or "Nothing seems off" results, but not deep insight into the reasons of something being off. 

## Asking for a favor
People don't need to like you to make you a favor, the question is what they will ask back.
If the attitude is negative, the price will be higher than the cost of favor for them.
