# Note 
The trait system to which basic defense can be used Endure/Dodge/Block/Parry hasn't been developed yet, and the spells are in their earliest generic version. Some parts of the magic and spells are placeholders.  
# Magic System
## Core Principles
Magic can be only casted by [[Mage]]s - people with inherited or acquired magical ability. 

If you want to be a [[Mage]] take the perk (req. GM permission) and as per perk rule your origin spell (Basic). 

Magic in Exceed is separated into passive and active effects. 
- Passive effects are governed by the **Limit** system - your character can only maintain a finite number of persistent magical effects simultaneously. This prevents endless buff stacking, but allows swapping of configurations of effects. 
- Active effects - instantaneous spells don't require a resource but an ability check to cast the spell. It requires a roll of [Dice+Spellcraft+Wit+Bonuses] to be cast against the DC of [8+Tier * 2]

# The Limit Stat
**Limit** represents your capacity to sustain persistent magical and supernatural effects.

**Base Limit:** Every character starts with Limit 3+Will+Spellcraft[N].

**Teams** - Mage can conduct a simple 1 minute [[Team Ritual]] with willing targets to form a team or include someone in a team. This allows mage to apply team effects on his allies while they are in his effect reach used granted by the ritual. Allies lose the effects when exiting and regaining while entering. This also allows the mage to cast harmful effects on his allies bypassing Endure check. To break away from the team you need to spend a full round on your turn and succeed a Will roll against ritualist's Arcane Lore.

Some state that the ritual is built that way, so parties won't screw their supports over loot.

## What Counts Against Limit
Everything with a Limit[N] trait. This usually includes.
    - Personal magical buffs and enchantments (Shield, Invisibility, Enhanced Strength)
    - Communal effects affecting self + allies (Group Fire Resistance, Party Water Walking)
    - Summoned creatures and constructs
    - Active magical items requiring concentration (enchanted armor, magical weapons)
These spells are generally cast outside of combat and require no roll. Swapping them in combat requires 1 action for 1 spell or 3 actions for all spells.

Multiple instances of the same effect do notÂ stack - only the strongest version applies.
# Spellcraft
Spellcraft is an Domain (skill following special progression rules). It progresses along the player learning spells and spellcraft perks. The pricing follows the pricing structure of attributes.
Each level of Spellcraft Unlocks ability to learn and cast spells of an appropriate tier.
## Learning Spells
### Cost of CP
Spells contribute to spell appropriate attributes and to Spellcraft at the same time.
Some spells have Basic/Advanced variations. Advanced variations require extra CP investment, they usually either lower the limit cost of the effect make it team wide or modify it in other ways.
### Spell Cost by Tier

| Tier | Basic Price | Advanced Price |
| ---- | ----------- | -------------- |
| 0    | 1           | 3              |
| 1    | 3           | 5              |
| 2    | 5           | 7              |
| 3    | 7           | 10             |
| 4    | 10          | 15             |
| 5    | 15          | 25             |
### Learning Duration and Requirement
Learning a spell from a library or a spellbook requires Arcane Lore or Theology of an equal or higher level and a source from which to learn. Learning from other mage's - a teacher - bypass this.  As per [[3.4 Learning and Training]] learning a spell will take 1 unmodified day of learning per CP.
# Spells

Spells that deal damage unless otherwise noted scale with number of dice equal to your Spellcraft.


## Spell shapes
Increase reach: +1AP per 10m.(make this progressive)
Increase number of targets: +2AP per target.

**Designer note** - the spells AP cost, distance and modifiers will be completely remade in the playtest 5 or 6 stage. Right now magic  acts more like a proof of concept.
~~Make cone - Increase tier by 1/2/3 for 3m/6m/10m.~~
~~Make sphere/emanation - increase tier by 1/2/3 for radius of 2/4/6~~
~~Make ray - increase Tier by 2. Spend 2AP after hit, to attack the same target again.~~
~~Make chain - chain from one target to another until the first successful block or parry.~~
~~Make Barrier - increase tier by~~ 
## Tier 0 Spells 
Reading the Limit column - For Basic/Advanced entries limit A/B/C means  A - basic on self. B - Advanced on self only, C - Advanced on the team. It can also be a static number.
Reading damage entry - All level 0 attacking spells can be upcharged to do Spellcraft damage dice instead of 1.
Reading limit entry - if the spell has limit entry - duration means that it can be cast separately for a short term effect, only one such short term effect can be kept at any moment.
