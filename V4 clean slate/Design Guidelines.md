# Costs
Perk Costs by Level:  
 - Level 0: Cheap (2), Average (3), Expensive  
 (5) - Basic techniques  
 - Level 1: Cheap (3), Average (5), Expensive  
 (10) - Refined skills  
 - Level 2: Cheap (5), Average (10), Expensive  
 (15) - Advanced techniques  
 - Level 3: Cheap (10), Average (15), Expensive  
  (20) - Master techniques  
 - Level 4: Cinematic effects (arbitrary costs)  
  - Legendary techniques

This cost logic is applied to both Spellcraft and Martial Domains. Despite Martial domains requiring half the cost, the other half in Spellcraft can be substituted by spells.

# Weights
## Weapon Weights
| Weapon Type | Weight |
|---|---|
| Light weapon | 0.5 kg |
| Average weapon | 2-3 kg |
| Large weapon | 3-5 kg |    
 0.5 for light, and 4 per tactical 6 for tactical  
  8 for defensive 10 for protective 12 for    
 bulwark 15 for titanic 20 for collossal. Buckler  
  for 1, shield for 3, Kite for 5, Tower for 10,    
 Fortress - 15. Small simulation - early mg1 en1    
 for 50kg (49) 20cp physical or 64kg for    
 early-mid (mg2 or en2)  its kite for 8kg, and    
 defensive for 8 kg, and weapon for 2kg so 18 kg,  
  20 with a secondary weapon. with 5kg of equip    
 on top we get early to light encumber and 12kg    
 to get early mid to light encumber. food and    
 water per day is 1kg min lets assume.

## Armor Weights
| Armor Type | Weight |     |
| ---------- | ------ | --- |
| Scout      | 4 kg   |     |
| Tactical   | 6 kg   |     |
| Defensive  | 8 kg   |     |

| Fortress | 15 kg |

## Other Equipment

## Encumbrance Simulation

**Early Character (MG1/EN1, 20 CP invested):**
- Capacity: 49 kg, No penalty threshold: 24.5 kg

**Early-Mid Character (MG2 or EN2):**  
- Capacity: 64 kg, No penalty threshold: 32 kg

**Sample Loadout:**
- Kite shield: 5 kg + Defensive armor: 8 kg + Average weapon: 2 kg + Secondary weapon: 2 kg + Basic equipment: 5 kg = **22 kg total**

**Results:**
- Early character: 22 kg = no encumbrance penalty
- Early-mid character: 22 kg + 12 kg additional gear = 34 kg = light encumbrance

Adding daily food/water (1 kg) pushes characters toward light encumbrance during travel.
