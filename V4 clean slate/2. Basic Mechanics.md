### Core Resolution System

**Formula:** 2d10 + Skill + Attribute + Bonuses vs. Difficulty

**Skill Application:**
- **Direct skill use:** Full skill bonus (e.g., Dancing to dance)
- **Raw attribute:** Attribute only, no skill bonus (e.g., Agility only to dance gracefully)
- **Related skill:** GM assigns -1 to -3 penalty based on how related (e.g., Fast-talk at -2 to cover bad dancing)
- **Creative alternatives:** GM discretion on penalty for innovative approaches

**Key Features:**
- Skills and attributes capped at 5 for bounded accuracy
- Positive feedback loop: Higher skills → higher attributes → better performance with related skills
- Players choose which attribute to increase when raising skills
- GM determines appropriate skill/attribute combinations and penalties situationally
