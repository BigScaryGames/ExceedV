## Combat Resolution
## Action Economy

**Base Actions:** 5 actions per turn for all characters

**Specialization Bonuses:**
- **Mental Actions:** Every 5 total points in Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) grants +1 Mental Action
- **Physical Actions:** Every 5 total points in Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) grants +1 Physical Action

**Action Restrictions:**
- Mental Actions can only be used for mental tasks: spells, social interactions, knowledge checks, perception, concentration
- Physical Actions can only be used for physical tasks: movement, attacks, athletics, manual tasks
- Base 5 actions can be used for either type

**Design Benefits:**
- Specialists get more actions in their domain of expertise
- Generalists maintain flexibility with unrestricted base actions
- Prevents "agility dominance" by spreading bonuses across multiple attributes
- Creates meaningful choice between specialization and versatility


### Determining Initiative

- **Standard Encounters:** Initiative = 2d10 + Perception attribute. This reflects awareness, reaction time, and mental preparedness when combat begins unexpectedly.
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles:** When initiating an ambush, relevant skills can provide modifiers to the initiative roll.
- **Ties:** Players go first in case of ties.
- **Modifiers:** Spells, abilities, and circumstances provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- **Delaying:** Done before the beginning of your turn to a predetermined point, only once per round. All beginning/end of turn effects are delayed with your action.

### Surprise Rounds

- **Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.
- **Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.
- **Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.

## Attacking and Defending
### Defensive Options
There are 3 main defensive options in the game.
Parry - MartialDomain + Agility/Dexterity (based on weapon type)
Dodge - Agility+Perception 
Block - ShieldDomain+Agility/Endurance (based on shield type)

Damage = WeaponDice+Might+Bonuses
Weapon skill determines the number of damage dice.
  - Skill 1-2: 1 dice
  - Skill 3-4: 2 dice
  - Skill 5+: 3 dice
Magic weapons can have an attribute and limit requirnment. They will provide the basic bonus to attacks, but won't provide other benefits like an increased die size, extra damage type, magical effects etc.
