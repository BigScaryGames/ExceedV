## Specializations

- **Infiltrator**: Specializes in entering and moving through guarded areas undetected.
- **Eavesdropper**: Skilled in surreptitiously gathering information.
- **Escape Artist**: Expertise in escaping from confinement and avoiding capture.

## Domain Abilities

### Level 1

- **Silent Steps** - You don't get movement penalty while sneaking. Get +2 to stealth if you take the movement penalty.
- **Deft Hands** - You know your way around traps, locks and sealed letters. You can attempt said actions without makeshift tools, or gain +2 to the attempt with tools.
- **Quick Disguise** - You can create a basic disguise in 10 minutes using available materials (1 minute at spy skill 2, 10 seconds at spy skill 3). Allows you to impersonate someone who is not you.
- **Keen Observation** - GM secretly rolls Perception + Spy against hidden doors and concealed weapons and active surveillance in close vicinity.

### Level 2

- **Master of Disguise** - You can impersonate specific individuals you've observed for at least an hour, or ones outside your race. The specific individual should be your size or a bit bigger.
- **Silent Takedown** - You can attack an unaware target unconscious in melee without invoking an initiative by rolling your attack + spy against the enemy DC. On the hit the attack counts as critical hit. If the target survives the attack roll initiative.
- **Information Network** - You can gather rumors and information in settlements where you've spent downtime, learning secrets that aren't common knowledge.
- **Perfect Identity** - You can maintain a complete false identity with documentation, contacts, and background that can withstand all but the most thorough investigations.

### Level 3

- **Shadow Master** - Once per day, you can become nearly invisible in shadows and dim light for 10 minutes, moving unseen even while observed.
- **Escape Artist** - You can slip out of restraints, squeeze through impossibly tight spaces, and always find a way out of confined areas. Gain +4 to escape attempts.
- **Deep Cover** - You can maintain multiple active identities simultaneously and switch between them seamlessly. Each identity has its own contacts and reputation.
- **Assassinate** - When making a Silent Takedown against a target with lower spy skill than yours, the target automatically falls unconscious or dies (your choice) without needing to roll.//TODO
