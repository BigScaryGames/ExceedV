## Domain Abilities

### Level 1

- **Comedian:** (Only lvl1 influencer feat) If you are friendly or higher with the target, outlandish requests or offenses can be downplayed as a joke without lowering the target's perception of you. Target is immune to this effect for one day.
- **Liar Liar** - You lie as your second breath. Get a +2 on deception checks and -2 on diplomacy.
- **Haggler** - you know how to trade down and sell yourself up. +2 on checks involving deals.
- **Public Speaker** - Reduce penalties based on the collective's size, you are trying to organize, or for convenience. People are more likely to find you taking command as something natural.

### Level 2

- **A deal impossible to refuse.** (PW2) You can add PW instead of your IQ when rolling for intimidation.
- **Fuck i'm out.** - When you succeed at demoralizing an enemy, they might reconsider fighting you.
- **What I want is none of your concern.** When gathering information, it is hard to figure out what you are truly searching for. To understand your true intentions, the opposite side has to try to gather information against your influence.
- **Rumour Monger** - you are the deal in the world of rumors. You can trade rumours (influence or cash), learning more while you do. GM determines the rumors you learn during the downtime.
- **Inspirer** - (req: you attempt the check first in the group) After succeeding at a check out of combat, you can use your reaction to give your 'influencer' bonus to the next ally attempting the check.

### Level 3

- **Into the battle.** You can roll initiative from Influencer, shouting at your enemies, attempting to demoralize them at the beginning of combat.
- **Leader** (Public speaker, Inspirer) - you not only lead but also inspire the people under your command. During combat, you can spend an action giving commands to your teammates. If they follow the instructions, they gain +1 to the appropriate rolls. Outside of combat, you can add your full influencer bonus to collective tasks. (At the expense of doing half the work yourself).
- **Cheat** - (liar liar) People are stupid. Well, that's what you have learned by cheating them so often. When someone neutral or above tries to figure out if you lie, they roll twice and take the worst results.
