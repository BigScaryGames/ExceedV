# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) project called "Exceed" maintained as an Obsidian vault. The game content is organized across multiple specialized markdown files for better maintainability and collaborative editing. 

## File Structure

- `ttrpg.md` - The main game document containing core rules, setting, and general content
- `MagicSystem.md` - Magic system rules and mechanics
- `Equipment.md` - Equipment lists, weapons, armor, and gear
- `WoundConsequencesTable.md` - Medical treatment and wound consequences system
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance file

## Working with the TTRPG

The game is designed to be developed across the specialized markdown files in this Obsidian vault. When making changes:

- Core game rules and setting go in `ttrpg.md` those are to be split into separate files when completed.
- Magic-related content goes in `MagicSystem.md`
- Equipment, weapons, and gear go in `Equipment.md`  
- Medical and wound systems go in `WoundConsequencesTable.md`
- Use markdown headers to organize sections within each file
- Keep the structure clean and navigable
- Update version numbers and dates when making significant changes

## Common Tasks

- Proofread user text  assisting with clarity, consistency, organization
- Providing user feedback, catching potential issues 
- Clean up repetitions and improve readability
- Provide user non-biased, non-yes-man feedback
- Maintain organized section structure using markdown headers
- Track development progress in the Designer Notes sections of relevant files
- Track todo-s in todo.md file
