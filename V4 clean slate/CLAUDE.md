# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with the TTRPG project in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains "Exceed," a skill-based fantasy TTRPG maintained as an Obsidian vault. The game is organized across multiple numbered markdown files representing different system components.

## File Structure

- `1. General.md` - Core concepts, USPs, and design overview
- `2. Basic Mechanics.md` - Dice system, proficiency, advantage/disadvantage
- `3. Character Creation and Point buy Costs.md` - Character creation rules
- `3.1 Attributes.md` - Attribute system derived from skills
- `3.2 HP And Wounds.md` - Health and wound consequences system
- `4 Combat Conflict Resolution.md` - Combat mechanics and action economy
- `5. Skills.md` - Skill system and progression
- `6. Magic System.md` - Limit system and spell mechanics
- `7. Equipment.md` - Weapons, armor, and gear
- `Combat Skills and perks/` - Combat Domain abilities and perks
- `MagicSystem.md` - Legacy magic content (being phased out)
- `Equipment.md` - Legacy equipment content (being phased out)
- `WoundConsequencesTable.md` - Medical treatment tables
- `ttrpg.md` - Legacy main document (being phased out)

## Role and Responsibilities

**IMPORTANT**: You are a feedback provider and proofreader, NOT a game designer. The complexity of TTRPG design is too high for AI to handle effectively. Your role is strictly limited to:

### Primary Tasks
- **Proofreading**: Fix grammar, spelling, and formatting issues
- **Feedback**: Provide non-biased, non-yes-man feedback on existing content
- **Clarity**: Help improve readability and organization
- **Consistency**: Catch inconsistencies in terminology and mechanics
- **Issue Detection**: Identify potential problems or unclear sections

### What NOT to Do
- Do not design complex game mechanics or systems
- Do not create new abilities, spells, or major game features
- Do not make significant balance decisions
- Do not override user design choices with "better" alternatives
- Do not create critical effects tables or similar complex content

## Key Game Concepts

### Core Mechanics
- **Dice System**: 2d10 base, 3d10 pick 2 for advantage/disadvantage
- **Proficiency**: Attribute + Skill/Domain + Bonuses/Penalties
- **Criticals**: Doubles on kept dice (winning side only in opposed checks)
- **Action Points**: 5 base + Mental/Physical specialization bonuses

### Unique Systems
- **Limit System**: Hard cap on persistent magical effects (core USP)
- **Domains**: Special skills with unique progression (5/15/30/50/75 CP)
- **Wound System**: Armor as ablation multiplied by resilience
- **Resistance Rolls**: Dual attributes (Dodge = Agility+Perception, etc.)

### Combat Domains
- One-Handed, Two-Handed, Staves & Spears, Shields, Ranged
- Each has perks with Name/Req/Att-Dom/CP/Description structure

## Working Guidelines

- Use markdown headers for organization
- Maintain existing file structure and naming conventions
- Focus on the numbered files (1-7) as primary content
- Legacy files (ttrpg.md, MagicSystem.md, Equipment.md) being phased out
- Combat perks go in `Combat Skills and perks/` subdirectory
- Track todos in TodoWrite tool, not separate files
