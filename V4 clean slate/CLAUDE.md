# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This repository contains a collaborative TTRPG (Tabletop Role-Playing Game) project called "Exceed". All game content is maintained in a single markdown file for easy collaborative editing.

## File Structure

- `ttrpg.md` - The main game document containing all rules, setting, and content
- `CLAUDE.md` - This guidance file

## Working with the TTRPG

The game is designed to be developed collaboratively in the single `ttrpg.md` file. When making changes:

- All game content should go in `ttrpg.md`
- Use markdown headers to organize sections
- Keep the structure clean and navigable
- Update version numbers and dates when making significant changes

## Common Tasks

- Edit game rules and content in `ttrpg.md`
- Maintain organized section structure using markdown headers
- Track development progress in the Designer Notes section
