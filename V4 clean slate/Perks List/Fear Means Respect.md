# Fear Means Respect

**Requirements:** Street Wisdom 3, Created reputation rumors about power/viciousness  
**Attribute:** Will  
**Cost:** 15 CP  

## Description
Your fearsome reputation causes people to avoid investigating your activities and look the other way when you're involved.

## Mechanics
- People will ignore or avoid investigating activities they believe you're involved in
- Information gathering attempts about you must overcome fear with DC based on reputation strength
- Reputation rumors have their own DC system (to be detailed later)
- Takes a hero-level character to openly stand against your reputation
- Does not protect against direct evidence or witnesses to major crimes
- May cause innocent people to be too afraid to interact with you normally
- Can backfire if reputation is exposed as false or if defeated publicly
- Requires maintaining the fearsome image through actions or continued rumors
- Particularly effective for intimidation-based criminal operations
