# Crisis of Replication

**Requirements:** History 1  
**Attribute:** Wit  
**Cost:** 5 CP  

## Description
When you fail a knowledge recall check, you receive one piece of true information and one piece of false information.

## Mechanics
- Triggers only on failed knowledge recall attempts
- GM provides two pieces of information: one true, one false
- You do not know which piece is true and which is false
- Represents conflicting sources, uncertain scholarship, or incomplete knowledge
- Can lead to interesting roleplaying opportunities and investigation
- May require additional research or verification to determine truth
- False information should be plausible and based on real misconceptions
- Can create dramatic tension when acting on uncertain knowledge
- Particularly interesting for historical research and scholarly debates
