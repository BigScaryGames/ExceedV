# Fuck I'm Out

**Requirements:** -  
**Attribute:** Charisma

## Description
When you successfully demoralize an enemy, they might reconsider whether fighting you is worth the trouble.

## Mechanics
- After successfully demoralizing an enemy, they may choose to withdraw from combat
- Effect depends on enemy morale, intelligence, and motivations
- More likely to work on intelligent enemies who can be reasoned with
- Less effective on mindless creatures, fanatics, or those with nothing to lose
- May cause enemies to flee, surrender, or seek alternative solutions
- Does not guarantee enemy withdrawal, but provides the opportunity
- Particularly effective against bandits, mercenaries, and pragmatic opponents
- GM determines enemy response based on circumstances and character motivations
- Can potentially end encounters without violence through reputation alone
