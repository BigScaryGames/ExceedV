# Design Decisions & Logic

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

**The Limit System** - The core innovation of Exceed is the "Limit" stat, which governs the maximum number of persistent magical and non-magical effects a character can sustain simultaneously.

#### Problem Solved
Traditional systems suffer from "pre-buff" issues where players stack numerous temporary bonuses before encounters, and "magic item bloat" where characters accumulate dozens of persistent magical effects. D&D 5e attempts to address this with concentration, time limits, and attunement slots, while PF2E uses 10 attunement slots but still allows hundreds of different buffs to stack.

#### Solution: Limit
The Limit stat creates a hard cap on the total number of active persistent effects, forcing meaningful tactical choices:
- Players must prioritize which effects to maintain
- No endless stacking of buffs
- Clear, trackable resource management
- Scales with character power (Limit increases as characters advance)
- Applies to all persistent effects: spells, permanent magic items, class abilities, etc.

This system eliminates bookkeeping nightmares while maintaining strategic depth through meaningful choice constraints.

## Combat Resolution
## Action Economy

**Base Actions:** 5 actions per turn for all characters

**Specialization Bonuses:**
- **Mental Actions:** Every 5 total points in Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) grants +1 Mental Action
- **Physical Actions:** Every 5 total points in Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) grants +1 Physical Action

**Action Restrictions:**
- Mental Actions can only be used for mental tasks: spells, social interactions, knowledge checks, perception, concentration
<!-- - Physical Actions can only be used for physical tasks: movement, attacks, athletics, manual tasks -->
- Base 5 actions can be used for either type

**Design Benefits:**
- Specialists get more actions in their domain of expertise
- Generalists maintain flexibility with unrestricted base actions
- Prevents "agility dominance" by spreading bonuses across multiple attributes
- Creates meaningful choice between specialization and versatility


### Determining Initiative

- **Standard Encounters:** Initiative = 2d10 + Perception attribute. This reflects awareness, reaction time, and mental preparedness when combat begins unexpectedly.
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles:** When initiating an ambush, relevant skills can provide modifiers to the initiative roll.
- **Ties:** Players go first in case of ties.
- **Modifiers:** Spells, abilities, and circumstances provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- **Delaying:** Done before the beginning of your turn to a predetermined point, only once per round. All beginning/end of turn effects are delayed with your action.

### Surprise Rounds

- **Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.
- **Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.
- **Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.

## Attacking and Defending
### Defensive Options
There are 3 main defensive options in the game.
Parry - WeaponsSkill + Agility/Dexterity (based on weapon type)
Dodge - Agility+Perception 
Block - ShieldSkill+Agility/Endurance (based on shield type)
Shields provide Defensive bonus that adds to all three abilities if raised.
Magic can provide other defensive options, according to the spells used.
### Offensive Options
All melee weapons use Agility as the main stat for offensive maneuvers.
Heavy - Allowing using might (generally heavy, blunt weapons)
Finesse - Allowing using Dexterity (generally piercing/slashing weapons).

Ranged weapons use Dexterity or Perception based on weapon type.

Certain perks allow to change the Attached attribute.

### Offensive Abilities
Offensive abilities can be normal - allowing all 3 defenses  have traits of:
AOE - can't parry without a perk or gear
Ranged - can't parry without a perk or gear
Unblockable - can't be blocked without a perk or gear


### Rolling for Damage 
When the attack hits roll for damage. 
Damage = WeaponDice+Attribute+Bonuses
Weapon skill determines the number of damage dice.
  - Skill 1-2: 1 dice
  - Skill 3-4: 2 dice
  - Skill 5+: 3 dice
Magic weapons can have an attribute and limit requirnment. They will provide the basic bonus to attacks, but won't provide other benefits like an increased die size, extra damage type, magical effects etc.
Light weapons generally have 1d4-1d6 WeaponDice, Normal - d6-d8, Heavy D8-D12.

  

## Actions in Combat
### Basic Strike
Each weapon takes 2-4 (maybe 1-3) action points to attack normaly, stepping 1 square forward as a part of the action. Light weapons - 2 action points, Normal (without a light or heavy trait) take 3 actions and heavy take 4 actions.
The action cost can be modified, combined or compressed with appropriate combat perks.
