# Design Decisions & Logic

### Unique Selling Proposition (USP)

**The Limit System** - The core innovation of Exceed is the "Limit" stat, which governs the maximum number of persistent magical and non-magical effects a character can sustain simultaneously.

#### Problem Solved
Traditional systems suffer from "pre-buff" issues where players stack numerous temporary bonuses before encounters, and "magic item bloat" where characters accumulate dozens of persistent magical effects. D&D 5e attempts to address this with concentration, time limits, and attunement slots, while PF2E uses 10 attunement slots but still allows hundreds of different buffs to stack.

#### Solution: Limit
The Limit stat creates a hard cap on the total number of active persistent effects, forcing meaningful tactical choices:
- Players must prioritize which effects to maintain
- No endless stacking of buffs
- Clear, trackable resource management
- Scales with character power (Limit increases as characters advance)
- Applies to all persistent effects: spells, permanent magic items, class abilities, etc.

This system eliminates bookkeeping nightmares while maintaining strategic depth through meaningful choice constraints.
