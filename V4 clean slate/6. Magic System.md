# Magic System

## Core Principles

Magic in Exceed is separated into passive and active effects. 
- Passive effects are governed by the **Limit** system - your character can only maintain a finite number of persistent magical effects simultaneously. This prevents endless buff stacking but allows swappable configurations of buffs. 
- Active effects - instantaneous spells don't require a resource but an ability to cast the spell. It requires a roll of [2d10+Spellcraft+Wit+Bonuses] to be cast against the DC of [10+SpellTier]

## The Limit Stat
**Limit** represents your capacity to sustain persistent magical and supernatural effects.

**Base Limit:** Every character starts with Limit 3+Will+Spellcraft[N].

**Teams** - Mage can conduct a simple 1 minute [[Team Ritual]] with willing targets to form a team or include someone in a team. This allows mage to apply team effects on his allies while they are in his general viscinity (for playtest it's the same scene, later I will make distance rules) allies lose the effects while away and regaining while near. This also allows the mage to cast harmful effects on his allies without resistance. To break away from the team you need to spend a full round on your turn. Some state that the ritual is built that way, so parties won't screw supports over loot.

## What Counts Against Limit
Everything with a Limit[N] trait. This usually includes.
    - Personal magical buffs and enchantments (Shield, Invisibility, Enhanced Strength)
    - Communal effects affecting self + allies (Group Fire Resistance, Party Water Walking)
    - Summoned creatures and constructs
    - Active magical items requiring concentration (enchanted armor, magical weapons)
These spells are generally cast outside of combat and require no roll. Swapping them in combat requires 1 action for 1 spell or 3 actions for all spells.

## Tiers of Magic
Magic like Everything in this game is separated into 0-5 tiers, as 5 is my magic number. to cast magic you need to have the [Spellcraft 0] domain.  The active magic requires a roll of [2d10+Spellcraft+Wit+Bonuses] to be cast against the DC of [10+SpellTier*2]
## Spellcraft
Spellcraft is an Domain (skill following special progression rules). It progresses along the player learning spells and it's progress is gated behind Arcane / Divine (Arcane Lore / Theology) magical theory. 
Each progress along the Spellcraft levels requires number of points to be spent on learning spells and spellcraft related perks - 10/+20/+30/+40/+50 to a total of 150cp. As mentioned above skills don't contribute to Spellcraft.
Each level of Spellcraft Unlocks ability to learn spells of an appropriate tier.
## Learning Spells
Spells contribute to spell appropriate attributes and to Spellcraft at the same time.
Some spells have Basic/Advanced variations. Advanced variations usually require extra CP investment, they usually either lower the cost of the effect sometimes even negating it, or make it team wide.
Upcasting spells - if you know a spell of a lower tier, it might have Upcasting rules, this means you can cast it at a higher tier trying to achieve one or multiple effects.

Perk: [[Spellcraft 0]][5](Wit/Will) prerequisite - (Arcane Lore 1, Theology 1)
-Unlocks Tier 0 spells.
-Unlocks [[Team Ritual]]
-All further spells will contribute to Spellcraft Stat.
## Tier 0 Spells
All basic variations cost 1 CP, all Advanced variations cost 3 CP.
Reading the Limit column - For Basic/Advanced entries limit A/B/C means  A - basic on self. B - Advanced on self only, C - Advanced on the team. It can also be a static number.
Reading damage entry - All level 0 attacking spells can be upcharged to do Spellcraft damage dice instead of 1.
Reading limit entry - if the spell has limit entry - duration means that it can be cast separately for a short term effect, only one such short term effect can be kept at any moment.
