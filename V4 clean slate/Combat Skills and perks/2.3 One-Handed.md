│ > I will take the Blade Dance - but call it a weapon flurry. Riposte is universal, weapon thrown is as well,     │  
│   ballance is bs, Second ability for 1H1 is Weapon Throw - 1H1 - you learn how to throw weapons, if it's a       │  
│   thrown weapon, increase the range by 3, if not to 3. Third one will be Double Striker - You have 2 weapons in  │  
│   your hands, At least one of your weapons has to be light, the second attack has +1 to hit. Thats tier 1.
