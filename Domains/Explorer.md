# Explorer (Focus)

Tracking, foraging, hunting, navigating terrain and sea, identifying common animals, beasts, and plants as well as finding safe spots to rest.

## Specializations

- **Ranger**: Specializes in tracking and covering footprints.
- **Cartographer:** Making maps and interpreting them.
- **Survivalist**: Skilled in navigating and surviving in hazardous conditions.

## Domain Abilities

### Level 1

- **Tracker** - You can track and cover tracks without moving at half-speed. You can choose to move at half-speed to get +2 to roll.
- **Awareness** - you can spend one hour in a wilderness terrain to investigate the types of creatures living in the area. You learn of the presence of all non-sentient creature types in the area.
- **Forager** - on sea or in a forest, you can procure food during camping and travelling for 4+ your explorer modifier without rolling dice if there is food to forage. (Foraging requires spending time and rolling otherwise)

### Level 2

- **Show the way** - you and your party ignore speed reductions due to natural terrain.
- **Cartographer's mind** - you recall all the roads and routes you have taken during last month and can't get lost in non-magical mazes. During downtime you can write the maps down.
- **Safe camp** - your camps and places of stay are harder to infiltrate. Everyone trying will have to roll against your Explorer skill or perception +2 whichever is higher, without circumstance bonuses of party being asleep and similar.
- **Animal affinity** - TBD

### Level 3

- **Environmental grace** - (rename) you prepare yourself and the party for harsh environmental conditions, reducing their effects by 1 step. (i.e. party will be fine -20 to +40 Celsius)
- **Camo expert** - when in natural environments you can roll initiative using Explorer Skill and provide the party +2 to checks to avoid notice.
- **Tamer** - TBD
