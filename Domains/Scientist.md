# Scientist (INT)

Study of biology, alchemy or chemistry, physics, and natural laws. Practical - engineering a pulley system, growing a tree, and making a Bronze Age furnace.

## Specializations

- **Botanist**: Specializes in plant life, including magical and medicinal plants.
- **Engineer**: Focuses on creating and understanding complex mechanical devices.
- **Meteorologist**: Expertise in weather patterns, air currents, and natural phenomena.

## Domain Abilities

### Level 1

- **Let me overthink this**: Spend double the time required for the check, adding your science modifier to the roll.
- **What if it explodes?** - You can craft bombs without risk of blowing up. Bombs in your possession are relatively safe.
- **No, not like that!** (MP1, reaction, trigger: an ally failed a check, you have at least 1 training at) - Roll Science with DC 0/2/4 depending on your science level. On success, you give your genius advice to an ally, providing +science level to their next similar check. If you crit fail, they become stunned 1 trying to understand that gibberish. This is what I was talking about.
- **Useless facts.** You can predict the weather with an 80% chance, and each recall of knowledge will provide you with a seemingly useless fact. Maybe just useless. Up to GM. GM will secretly roll if you know something important to the plot.

### Level 2

- **Field Chemistry** (what if it explodes?) As an action costing 1 MP, you can create and throw a basic explosive that deals damage in a small area. (TBD)
- **Scary words** - You can use Science Linguo to coerce people outside of combat.
- **PhD (status)** - Add PhD to your character sheet in the 'title' section. You don't need to roll deception to state that you have a PhD. People with PhD will have a relationship baseline of 'friendly'. Your surrender attempts will be accepted as if you were a nobleman.

### Level 3

- **Student slaves**: When performing a collective mental task outside combat, that can be performed using multiple domains, your skill allows you to test all the approaches. The task takes twice the time, but all can use the best modifier amongst the group.
