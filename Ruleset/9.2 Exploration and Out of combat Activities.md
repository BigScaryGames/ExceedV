### Circumvent Security Device
This action allows a character to disarm traps, pick locks, bypass wards, or overcome similar security devices. The device's entry specifies the number of successes required, the time for each attempt, the applicable skills, and the consequences of failure.

#### Example
**Simple Lock**
- **Successes Required:** 1
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 round
- **Skills:** Lock-picking, Breaking
- **Consequence:** None; the attempt simply fails.

**Alarming Ward**
- **Successes Required:** 2
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 round
- **Skills:** Magical Theory, Lock-picking (at a -2 penalty),
- **Consequence:** Failure triggers the magical alarm.

**High-end Wall Safe**
- **Successes Required:** 3
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 hour
- **Skills:** Lock-picking, Breaking
- **Consequence:** On a failure, the lock jams, increasing the total successes required by 1 (max 5). A critical failure permanently jams the safe.
