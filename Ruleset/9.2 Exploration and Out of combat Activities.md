# **Circumvent Security Device**

**Traits:** —

This activity allows a character to **disarm traps**, **pick locks**, **bypass wards**, or overcome similar **security devices**.  
Each device defines:
- **Successes required**
- **Time per attempt**
- **Applicable skills**    
- **Consequences of failure**
---
## **How It Works**
When attempting to circumvent a device, roll the relevant skill once per attempt.  
Each success counts toward the total number required.  
Unless stated otherwise:
- A **failure** wastes the time spent.
- A **critical failure** escalates the situation at the GM’s discretion (jammed lock, triggered trap, etc.).
---
## **Examples**
### **Average Lock**
- **Successes Required:** 1
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 **Minuta**
- **Skills:** Lock-picking, Breaking
- **Consequence:** None — the attempt simply fails.
---
### **Alarming Ward**

- **Successes Required:** 2
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 **Breather**
- **Skills:** Magical Theory; Lock-picking (–2 penalty)
- **Consequence:** On failure, the **magical alarm triggers**.
---
### **High-End Wall Safe**
- **Successes Required:** 3   
- **Time per Attempt:** 1 **Shift**   
- **Skills:** Lock-picking, Breaking
- **Consequence:**
    - On **failure**, the lock jams, increasing the total successes required by **+1** (maximum 5).
    - On **critical failure**, the safe becomes jammed, requiring at least a 4 shifts worth of repair.
# Forage
#Traits: #Exploration , Speed Penalty 1.
You try to gather food, herbs or materials. 
The DC is static based on the nature of the place and availability of resources. Skill is dependent on the environment and the target of foraging, usually being Biology for herbs, survival for food and water and burning materials in wilderness, streetwise for in city environments.

Each attempt at Foraging takes one Shift. 
You can forage on the go, during marching, camping etc by lowering your **speed by 1** and increases the **DC by 2**. 
Number of rations/materials foraged are loosely rules by the GM.
### Critical effects
On a critical success you find double the amount or something extra up to GM.
On a critical failure you encounter possible trouble - misidentify the food, get predator's attention, or similar.
