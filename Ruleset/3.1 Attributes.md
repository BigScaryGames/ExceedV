## The Eight Attributes

**Mental Attributes:**
- **Perception** - Awareness, noticing details, sensing danger
- **Will** - Mental fortitude, discipline, magical capacity
- **Charisma** - Force of personality, leadership, presence
- **Wit** - Quick thinking, problem-solving, magical control

**Physical Attributes:**
- **Might** - Raw strength, damage output
- **Endurance** - Stamina, toughness, resilience
- **Agility** - Speed, reflexes, dodging ability
- **Dexterity** - Precision, fine motor control, accuracy

## Attribute Progression

**Starting Value:** 0 in all attributes

**Thresholds:** Accumulate points from skills and perks to increase attribute tiers
- 10 points = Attribute 1
- 30 points = Attribute 2
- 60 points = Attribute 3
- 100 points = Attribute 4
- 150 points = Attribute 5

**Maximum:** All attributes capped at 5

**Progression:** Attributes are progressing indirectly. Skills and perks grant attribute points equal to experience points spent. When purchasing a skill or perk with multiple attribute options (e.g., Tracking: Perception/Endurance), you choose which attribute receives the XP.

## Bonus Action Points:
- Every 5 Mental attributes = +1 Mental Action Point
- Every 5 Physical attributes = +1 Physical Action Point
