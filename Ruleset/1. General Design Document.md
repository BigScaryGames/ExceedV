## Core Game Concepts

### What Makes Exceed Different
1. **Limit System** - Prevents endless buff stacking by limiting active magical effects making
2. **Armor as Stamina Multiplier** - Armor provides ablation based on character resilience
3. **Skills Drive Attributes** - Attributes derive from skills, creating positive feedback loops

### Target Audience
- GURPS players wanting less complexity
- Pathfinder and DnD players wanting more character control
- Players who prefer earned progression over class-based advancement
- Groups who enjoy slow-burn character development

## Design Notes
*This is game design documentation, not a final rulebook. Includes design reasoning and decision rationale. Term standardization pending next playtest.*

### Key Design Logic
- **Bounded Accuracy:** Skills and attributes capped at 5 for predictable math and balanced progression
- **Positive Feedback Loop:** Higher skills → higher attributes → better performance with related skills
- **Player Agency:** Players choose which attribute to increase when raising skills
- **GM Flexibility:** GM determines appropriate skill/attribute combinations and situational penalties

### Attribute System Philosophy
**Bottom-Up Skill-Driven Design:**
- Cannot directly buy attributes - only skills and abilities that grant attribute points
- Skills increase related attributes as secondary benefits
- This creates natural relationships between the 8 core attributes without explicit hierarchy

**Design Decision:** Removed the hierarchical attribute structure (Body/Mind → 4 main → 8 sub) as it created unnecessary complexity with the bottom-up system. Skills naturally create relationships between the 8 core attributes without needing to show the implicit 2→4→8 structure (2 cores: body and mind, each having control and raw power, split into usage methods).
