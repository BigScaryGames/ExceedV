WIP MS6
When wielding a weapon in each hand:
- You can attack with either weapon using its normal AP cost
- Off-hand attacks take -2 penalty unless the weapon is Light
- You gain access to dual-wield perks and abilities

**[[Ambidexterity]]** removes the off-hand penalty for non-Light weapons.

**Shields:** Don't qualify for dual-wield perks/abilities unless you have **[[Multipurpose Shield]]**. You can still make normal shield boss attacks.
