Ranged attacks must overcome a **Distance DC** before the defender rolls.

| Range Increment | Distance DC |
|-----------------|-------------|
| 0 (point blank) | 10 |
| 1 | 12 |
| 2 | 14 |
| 3 | 16 |
| 4 | 18 |
| 5 | 20 |

Attacks that roll below the Distance DC miss automatically - the shot goes wide before reaching the target.

If the attack equals or exceeds the Distance DC, the defender may use Block or Dodge against the attack roll as normal.

The **[[Aim]]** action reduces the Distance DC by 2.

Each weapon defines its own range increment distances (e.g., a shortbow might have 15m increments, while a longbow has 25m).
