**Limit** represents your capacity to sustain persistent magical and supernatural effects.

## Base Limit

`Limit = 3 + Will + Spellcraft`

## What Counts Against Limit

Everything with a Limit[N] trait. This usually includes:
- Personal magical buffs and enchantments (Shield, Invisibility, Enhanced Strength)
- Communal effects affecting self + allies (Group Fire Resistance, Party Water Walking)
- Summoned creatures and constructs
- Active magical items requiring concentration (enchanted armor, magical weapons)

## Managing Limit

- #Attuned magic is generally configured outside of combat and requires no roll
- Swapping in combat: 1 action for 1 effect, or 3 actions for all effects
- Multiple instances of the same effect do not stack - only the strongest version applies

## Teams

Mages can conduct a simple breather-long [[Team Ritual]] with willing targets to form a team. This allows:
- Mage can apply team effects on allies while they are in effect reach
- Allies lose effects when exiting range and regain them when entering
- Mage can cast harmful effects on allies bypassing Endure check

To break away from a team: Spend a full round on your turn and succeed a Will roll against the ritualist's Magical Theory skill.
