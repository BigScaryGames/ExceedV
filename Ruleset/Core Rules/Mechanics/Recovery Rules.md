## Sleep
A **Night's Rest** consists of **3 or more Shifts** (~8 hours).
Each character requires at least **3 Shifts of sleep** within a Day to recover normally.

## Recovery Time by Quality

Base recovery times from [[Mechanics/Severity Levels]] are modified by rest quality:

| Quality         | Modifier   | Sev 0 (Shift) | Sev 1 (Day) | Sev 2 (Tenday) | Sev 3 (Season) |
| --------------- | ---------- | ------------- | ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 0 - Nonexistent | ×10 slower | 1 Day         | 10 Days     | 1 Season       | 10 Seasons     |
| 1 - Poor        | ×2 slower  | 2 Shifts      | 2 Days      | 2 Tendays      | 2 Seasons      |
| 2 - Adequate    | Base       | 1 Shift       | 1 Day       | 1 Tenday       | 1 Season       |
| 3 - Good        | ×2 faster  | 3 Breathers   | 5 Shifts    | 5 Days         | 50 Days        |
| 4 - Excellent   | ×4 faster  | 1-2 Breathers | 2-3 Shifts  | 2.5 Days       | 25 Days        |
| 5 - Exceptional | ×10 faster | 1 Breather    | 1 Shift     | 1 Day          | 1 Tenday       |

## Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue

- Going a full **Day** without sleep: Gain **1 level of Fatigue**, plus **+1** for every **5 Shifts** (~12 hours) thereafter
- Fatigue from lack of sleep cannot be removed until completing a **full extended rest** of **3 + Fatigue Level Shifts**
- Magical or alchemical solutions may delay effects or temporarily reduce Fatigue, but do **not remove** accumulated fatigue

## Recovering from Fatigue

- Each **Rest Shift** removes **1 level of Fatigue** (except fatigue from sleep deprivation)
- **Comfortable rest**, proper food, or **medical care** may remove an **additional level** per Night's Rest (GM discretion)
- Characters cannot recover from Fatigue while **marching, exploring, or in combat**

## Downtime Activities During Recovery

During recovery, characters may engage in light downtime activities such as **learning or income work**, as long as the GM judges these do not meaningfully interrupt rest.

See [[9.1 Time and Travel#Exceed TIME||Time in Exceed]] for time magnitude reference.
