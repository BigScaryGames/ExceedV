## Re-injury, Recovery, Permanent Effects

**Natural Recovery:**
In case when appropriate treatment was not provided, but escalation didn't occur, the time to recover increases by 1 step:
- Minor: 1 day
- Moderate: Tendays
- Serious: Season
- Critical: Ten Seasons

GM decides on any permanent effects.

**Re-injury Penalty:** If wounded again before completing rest, previous consequences reopen alongside new ones

**Multiple Wounds:** Characters can suffer multiple consequences simultaneously; when treating a wound you treat one of the wounds

**Permanent Effects:** Severity 3 consequences may leave permanent effects even after successful treatment, up to GM
