## Combat Resolution
## Action Economy

**Base Action Points:** 5 AP per turn for all characters and one Reaction[R]. Using a reaction reduces the number of AP on the start of the next turn by 1. If you have Reactive or other perks allowing multiple reactions - reduce the number of actions by number of reactions used.

**Specialization Bonuses:**
- **Mental AP:** Every 5 total points in Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) grants +1 Mental AP
- **Physical AP:** Every 5 total points in Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) grants +1 Physical AP
- Mental AP can only be used for mental actions: spells, social interactions, knowledge checks, perception, concentration
- Physical AP can only be used for physical actions: movement, attacks, athletics, manual tasks

### Determining Initiative

- **Standard Encounters:** Initiative = 2d10 + Perception. This reflects awareness, reaction time, and mental preparedness when combat begins unexpectedly.
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles:** When initiating an ambush, you can roll relevant skills.
- **Ties:** Players go first in case of ties, for others - up to GM.
- **Modifiers:** Spells, abilities, and circumstances can provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- **Delaying:** Done before the beginning of your turn to a predetermined point, only once per round. All beginning/end of turn effects are delayed with your action.

### Surprise Rounds

- **Ambush Coordination:** Ambushing side rolls initiative as one group using their leader's roll, representing coordinated surprise attacks.
- **Stunned Targets:** Ambushed combatants who roll 5 or lower than the ambush leader become Stunned 3 (lose first 3 actions, cannot use reactions) as they process the situation.
- **Ambush Sites:** Favorable ambush locations can provide bonuses to the ambush initiative roll.

## Attacking and Defending
All offensive effects have one or more traits of #Strike, #Projectile, #Burst, #Mind, #Body. Those determine which defenses can be used against them (see below).

**Unopposed:** Roll defense against a static DC (traps, environmental hazards, ongoing effects)
**Opposed:** Roll defense against attacker's roll (creature attacks, targeted spells)

Attack and defense rolls follow standard check rules from [[2. Basic Mechanics]]: 2d10 + Skill + Attribute (+ Bonuses/Penalties).

### Defensive Options
There are 4 main defensive options in the game.

Parry - Martial Domain + Agility/Dexterity (based on weapon type)
Block - Shield Domain+Agility/Endurance/Might (based on shield type)
Dodge - Agility+Perception
Endure - Endurance+Will
#### Usage of defenses.
**#Strike** - Parry, Block, Dodge
- Melee attacks, touch, melee and some other spells.
**#Projectile** - Block, Dodge (Parry with a Perk)
- Arrows, thrown weapons, targeted ranged spells.
**#Burst** - Dodge  (Block or Parry with perks)
- Explosions, fireballs.
**#Mind** - Endure
- Fear, charm, mind control, mental distortion
**#Body** - Endure
- Poison, disease, exhaustion, body-affecting curses



Shields provide bonuses to Block, Dodge, and Parry defenses. With appropriate perks, shields can also provide bonuses to Endure rolls.

Magic can provide other defensive options, according to the spells used.

### Offensive Attribute
All melee weapons can use Agility as the main stat for offensive maneuvers.

Heavy - Allowing using might (generally heavy, blunt weapons)

Finesse - Allowing using Dexterity (generally piercing/slashing weapons).

Ranged weapons use Dexterity or Perception based on weapon type.

Certain perks allow you to change the used attribute.


### Rolling for Damage
When the attack hits roll for damage.
Damage = WeaponDice + Might + Bonuses
Weapon Skill level determines the number of damage dice.
  - Skill 1-2: 1 dice
  - Skill 3-4: 2 dice
  - Skill 5+: 3 dice

Light weapons generally have d4/d6 WeaponDice, Normal - d6/d8, Heavy d8/d12.

**Damage Application:** Damage depletes Stamina first, then Health (see [[3.2 HP And Wounds]]).



## Actions in Combat
### Basic Attack
Each weapon takes 2-4 AP to attack normally, and allows stepping 1 meter forward as a part of the maneuver. Light weapons - 2 action points, Normal (without a light or heavy trait) take 3 actions and heavy take 4 actions.
The action cost can be modified, combined or compressed with appropriate combat perks.
