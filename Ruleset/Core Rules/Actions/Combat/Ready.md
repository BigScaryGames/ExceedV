# Ready

**AP Cost:** Variable (activity AP cost)
**Traits:** #Interact, +Traits of the prepared action

Prepare an action that will occur outside your turn.

## Procedure

1. Spend the number of AP the readied activity requires
2. Declare a loose trigger condition (e.g., "when enemy enters reach," "when ally is attacked," "when door opens")
3. End your turn immediately
4. When the trigger occurs, spend your Reaction to execute the readied activity

## Observability

Most combat readying is obvious to observers - you've summoned a ball of fire and hold it in your hands, entered a striking stance, aimed your bow at the doorway, or positioned your spear defensively. GMs are advised to use common sense to manage metagaming. Hidden preparations require appropriate Stealth checks or concealment.

## Examples

- **Ready a strike:** Spend weapon AP, trigger "when enemy enters reach," execute strike as Reaction
- **Ready a spell:** Spend spell AP, trigger "when ally falls below half HP," cast spell as Reaction
- **Ready movement:** Spend movement AP, trigger "when enemy charges," move as Reaction

**Enhanced by:** Various perks may reduce the AP cost of readying specific activities
