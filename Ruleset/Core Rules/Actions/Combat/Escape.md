**Roll:** Athletics or Escape Artist vs grappler's Brawling + Might/Agility

Attempt to break free from the [[Condition - Grabbed|Grabbed]] condition. On success, both parties lose the Grabbed condition.

Alternative: Instead of rolling Escape, you may make an unarmed or weapon strike against the grappler. If you hit, you also end the Grabbed condition for both parties.

Regular attacks against the grappler do not end the grab - only dedicated escape attempts or strikes intended to break free do. The grab also ends if the grappler goes down.
