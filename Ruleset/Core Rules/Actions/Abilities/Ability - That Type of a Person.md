When an ally is downed within your Speed distance, you run to that space as a free action. This movement doesn't provoke reactions. When you stand on your downed ally's space, all offensive actions including AOE directed at the ally are directed at you instead. You can't leave the space until the end of combat or until the ally loses the unconscious condition.
