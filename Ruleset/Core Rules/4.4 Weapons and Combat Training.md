## 4.4 Weapons and Combat Training

Combat skill in Exceed is determined by one's **Combat Domain**.

To advance in the Combat Domain, you must learn combat perks. Most combat perks require **Weapon Training** - proficiency in a weapon category gained through training perks with the #WeaponTraining trait.

**Weapon Categories:**

- **Brawling** - Fists, kicks, grappling
- **Shield** - All shields
- **Blades** - Knives, swords, daggers, sabres (slashing/piercing edged weapons)
- **Axes** - Axes, picks, cleavers (chopping weapons)
- **Impact** - Clubs, hammers, maces, flails (bludgeoning weapons)
- **Polearms** - Spears, staves, halberds, pikes, glaives (long reach weapons)
- **Bows** - Bows, crossbows (string-drawn ranged)
- **Thrown** - Darts, javelins, throwing axes, slings (hand-propelled ranged)

**Untrained Penalty:** Using a weapon without training in its category imposes a -2 competence penalty to all rolls.

### Martial Domain Progression

Martial Domain advances through XP spent on combat perks and weapon training:
- **Tier 1:** 10 XP total
- **Tier 2:** 30 XP total
- **Tier 3:** 60 XP total
- **Tier 4:** 100 XP total

### Perk Requirements Format

Combat perks show **(Attribute/Attribute)** for XP contribution when purchased.
Combat perks may require weapon training and/or wielding specific weapons:
**Training Requirements:**

- **"Category 1/Category 2"** - Requires training in Category 1 OR Category 2
- **"Category 1+Category 2"** - Requires training in BOTH Category 1 AND Category 2

**Using the Perk:** To use a perk, you must be wielding a weapon from one of the required categories (or both, if the perk requires multiple weapons simultaneously).
