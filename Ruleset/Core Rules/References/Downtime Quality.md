Quality level determines how efficiently you can train, recover, or live during downtime. The same scale applies to training conditions, medical care, and lodging.

| Level | Name | Multiplier | Examples |
|-------|------|------------|----------|
| 0 | **Nonexistent** | ×0.1 (10× slower) | No teacher/materials, no care, homeless/exposed |
| 1 | **Poor** | ×0.5 (2× slower) | Bad manual, distracted mentor, unsafe rest, slums |
| 2 | **Adequate** | ×1 (base) | Competent teacher OR manual, safe shelter, basic care |
| 3 | **Good** | ×2 (2× faster) | Skilled teacher AND materials, trained medic, private room |
| 4 | **Excellent** | ×4 (4× faster) | Master teacher, full facilities, expert care, fine suite |
| 5 | **Exceptional** | ×10 (1 mag faster) | Legendary master, perfect setup, master healer + magic, palace |

## Rank and Access
Organizations vary in what they can provide for each rank. Unless otherwise noted by GM your [[References/Rank System|Rank]] in an organization can provide access to facilities equal to your rank. 
Organizations with specific focus can provide +1 to that.
E.g. Church that has hospitals will provide +1 to your rank and military will provide at least Adequate training environment.
