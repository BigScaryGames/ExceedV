# 2. Core Resolution System

## Dice System

In Exceed checks are resolved with d10 dice.

| Roll Type | Dice |
|-----------|------|
| Normal | 2d10 |
| Advantage | 3d10, keep 2 highest |
| Disadvantage | 3d10, keep 2 lowest |

**Criticals:** Doubles on the kept 2d10 can turn successes into critical success, and failures into critical failure.

## Roll Formulas

**Ability Roll:** Dice + Skill + Attribute + Bonuses/Penalties
**Resistance Roll:** Dice + Attribute1 + Attribute2 + Bonuses/Penalties
