# Hit Points and Wounds System

## Hit points
All characters have two pools of Hit Points.
**Health** - represents the characters vitality.
**Stamina**  - represents the characters armor and resilience. A layer of gear and toughness to absorb punishment before vital damage.
During combat, unless otherwise mentioned Stamina pool is depleted first.
All human characters start with:
- **2 Max Wounds**
- **5 HP Per Wound**
## HP Calculation
Stamina = (Armor + Endurance) * Max Wounds
Health = HP Per Wound * Max Wounds + ExtraHP

**Total HP = Stamina+Health**

### Increasing Hit Points

Hit points can be increased through **Conditioning** perks - specialized training regimens that build both physical resilience and provide unique benefits at mastery.

#### Conditioning Perks (v0.5)
Conditioning perks are **leveled perks** found in `Ruleset/Perks/CombatPerks/Conditioning/`. Each can be taken multiple times and provides both HP progression and a thematic capstone reward.

**Available Conditioning Perks:**
- **Poison Resistance** (Medicine 1) - Resist toxins
- **Waterfall Training** (Athletics 1) - Resist forced movement
- **Mental Resilience** (Will 2) - Resist mental effects
- **Cold Conditioning** (Survival 1) - Thrive in cold
- **Heat Conditioning** (Survival 1) - Thrive in heat
- **Battle Scarred** (Martial Domain 1) - Easier to heal
- **Magical Conditioning** (Mage, Spellcraft 1) - Resist transmutation

**Progression:**
- **Cost:** Max_Wounds × level XP
- **Levels 1-4:** Gain +1 HP per level
- **Level 5:** Consolidates into +1 Max_Wounds AND grants capstone effect
  - The new wound operates like all others (gains full armor and endurance bonuses)
  - Capstone effects vary by conditioning type (see individual perk descriptions)

**Example:** Character with 2 Max_Wounds and 0 Endurance, +2 Armor
- **Level 1 Poison Resistance:** Costs 2 XP, gains +1 HP (Total: 11 Health, 4 Stamina = 15 HP)
- **Level 2:** Costs 4 XP, gains +1 HP (Total: 12 Health, 4 Stamina = 16 HP)
- **Level 3:** Costs 6 XP, gains +1 HP (Total: 13 Health, 4 Stamina = 17 HP)
- **Level 4:** Costs 8 XP, gains +1 HP (Total: 14 Health, 4 Stamina = 18 HP)
- **Level 5:** Costs 10 XP, consolidates to 3 Max_Wounds, gains +2 vs poison (Total: 15 Health, 6 Stamina = 21 HP)

#### Deprecated: ExtraHP Perk (v0.4)
The generic ExtraHP perk has been replaced by Conditioning perks in v0.5. Characters with ExtraHP should migrate to an appropriate Conditioning perk.

### Progression Examples
- **Starting:** 2 wounds × 5 HP = 10 total HP
- **+1 Wound (10 XP):** 15 total HP (21 with armor 2)
- **+2 Wounds (20 XP):** 20 total HP (32 with armor 3)
