# Conditions Logic
fists lets look at bonus and penalty types

## Bonus Types
*Stacking rules: Same type = Don't Stack, take higher. Different types = Stack.*

| Trait        |
| ------------ |
| #Competence  |
| #Morale      |
| #Enhancement |
| #Luck        |
| #Equipment   |
| #Situational |
| #Armor       |
| #Size        |
From these - 
Armor penalty- doing that will be a bad design choice.
Morale - good choice - just flat penalty or bonus 
Competence - poor choice - requires recalculation so will lead to back and forth
Enhancement - good choice - not much to recaltulate.
Luck - good choice
Equpment - hard to track, can be put in enhancement and will be good.
Situational - good choice -doesn't stack
Size - no comment

so we get
Enhancement - for Attribute penalties
DOT conditions - for Damage on time
Morale Penalty - for action types - like offensive/defensive/all 
Enhanceme

nt penalty - clumsy(AG+DX), enfeebled(MG+EN), Distracted WL+PR and Befuddled CH+WT
Luck - simple enogh.
Situational - like flanked, prone and similar.
