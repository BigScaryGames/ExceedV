# Exceed  Time
Time in Exceed is measured using a power of 10 system starting with heartbeats and ending with days.
Time units are:

| Unit     | Duration           | Reference and terms |
| -------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Hearbeat | Less then a second | Beat, instant       |
| Round    | 10 Hearbeats       | 9s, a short moment  |
| Minuta   | 10 Rounds          | 90s, a short task   |
| Breather | 10 Minutas         | 15m, Quick rest     |
| Shift    | 10 Breathers       | A work/study shifts |
| Day      | 10 Shifts          | From dawn to next   |
| Tenday   | 10 Days            | 2 'work weeks'      |
| Season   | 10 Tendays(100d)   | 1/3 of a year       |
When abilities mention time  change by magnitude - move the unit up or down by the magnitude. E.g. wound that needs a season to recover with aid will recover in a Tenday. 
In the world of Exceed, towns usually have full-day clocks that ring bells every half a shift after dawn, and workplaces have shift clocks, with the last section of a shift being a usual breather time.

Full night's rest requires 3 Shifts.
# **Travel Speed**

### **Travel Speed**

Each character has a **Travel Speed**, equal to their **Speed – #Exploration activities** for that Shift.  
Use the **lowest Travel Speed** in the party when calculating group travel.

Apply **Route Difficulty** as follows:
- **Open Route:** Travel Speed × 3 km
- **Moderate Route:** Travel Speed × 2 km
- **Strenuous Route:** Travel Speed × 1 km
- **Very Strenuous Route:** Cannot be traveled without first reducing its difficulty.
---

### **Reducing Route Difficulty**
Some abilities, skills, and spells can help you overcome harsh routes.  
Effects from the **same source** (such as a single spell, perk, or exploration activity) **stack**, while **different sources do not**, allowing you to reduce the route penalty multiple times when using related effects.

---

### **Marching and Fatigue**
You can make up to **three Marches per day** without a check.  
Each additional March beyond the third requires a **DC 10 Endure** or **Running** check.

- Increase the DC by **+5** for each consecutive extra March that day.
- On failure, you gain the **Fatigued** condition.
- You cannot **Force March** while Fatigued.
---
### **Forced March**

A **Forced March** doubles your travel distance for one March (×2) but counts as **two Marches** toward your daily limit.  
During this, no character can perform more than **one Exploration activity**.

If you fail the fatigue check, the Forced March becomes a **normal March**, and you gain the **Fatigued** condition at the end of it.

---

#### **Example**
If you march three times and then continue, the check DC is **10**.  
If you choose to Force March instead, the DC is **15**.
# Earth time Variant rule
Time in Exceed can be counted as normal, with rounds, minutes, hours, and weeks. But is intended to be used with Exceed's time system.
In Some abilities might mention that they lower or increase the required time spent by a magnitude or multiplication. 
When multiplying, we use normal multiplication rules, and when changing magnitude, the magnitude steps are.
||1 Round|
|2|1 Minute|
|3|10 Minutes|
|4|1 Hour|
|5|1 Day|
|6|1 Week|
|7|1 Month|
|8|1 Year|
with a 10 multiplier after that.
### travel earth time
Using Earh time count 1km per speed, half for difficult terrain, and quarter for greater. All rounded down.
