# 8. Social Interactions

Whether conducting negotiations, gathering gossip, conning someone, or talking your way out of jail, social interactions follow a set of rules.

## Attitude System

## Social Actions

### Affect Attitude

1. **Choose a skill:** Negotiations, Manipulation, Gossip, Leadership, Fast-talk (first impression only), Intimidation (efficient for lowering attitude), Streetwise, or situationally appropriate skill (Smithing with a smith, Magical Theory with a mage)

2. **Roleplay the interaction** if possible

3. **Roll:** Skill + Charisma (or other stat per GM allowance) vs target's opposing check (GM's choice)

The target will either change attitude or resist. GM may decide your strategy is particularly effective or counterproductive.

### Detect Falsehood

When trying to detect manipulation and lies:
- **Roll:** Perception + Manipulation OR Perception + Will (whichever is higher)
- This is a blind GM check
- Result: "Something seems off" or "Nothing seems off" (not deep insight into reasons)

### Asking for a Favor

People don't need to like you to do a favor - the question is what they'll ask in return.

| Attitude | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Negative | Price higher than cost to them |
| Neutral | Win-win condition |
| Positive | Less than cost, or IOU for future favor |

You can use social skills to improve the deal (+1 attitude for this favor). On failure with negative attitude or critical failure, the price increases.

NPCs can decline, counter offer, or accept.

### Fast-Talk

**Roll:** Fast-talk vs Detect Falsehood (or Perception/Will)

GM adds bonuses from rank and appearance.

## GM Guidelines

Most calculations happen prior to rolls. Use Appearance, rank difference, and similar factors to set initial attitude.

**First meeting:** Typically -2 to +2 range
- NPCs don't care much about PCs most of the time
- Friendly NPCs might suggest diplomacy
- Unfriendly ones may pursue conflict when interests align

**Progression:** First interaction can reach -3/+3, further requires actions or stakes.
