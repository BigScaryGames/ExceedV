# Creating a character
**Step 1:** Decide on a name and concept for your character.

**Step 2:** GM awards starting Experience Points (XP) in two categories:

**XP Categories:**
- **Combat XP:** HP (ExtraHP perk), combat skills, combat-related perks
- **Non-Combat XP:** Social, knowledge, crafting, wilderness skills, and related perks
Both types can be spent on learning spells.

**Step 3:** Spend XP on skills, perks and spells. Each purchase shows (Attribute1) or (Attribute1/Attribute2) indicating which attributes can benefit. When making a purchase, you choose one of the listed attributes to apply the XP toward. When attributes reach tier thresholds (10/30/60/100/150), you gain +1 to that attribute.

**Step 4:** Calculate bonus actions:
- **Mental Actions:** Every 5 total Mental attributes (Perception + Will + Charisma + Wit) = +1 Mental Action
- **Physical Actions:** Every 5 total Physical attributes (Might + Endurance + Agility + Dexterity) = +1 Physical Action

**Step 5:** Select starting gear and calculate final statistics:
- **HP:** See [[3.2 HP And Wounds]] for Health and Stamina calculation
- **Initiative:** 2d10 + Perception
- **Attack & Damage:** See [[4. Combat Conflict Resolution]] for combat formulas
- **Speed:** 5 + Agility + (Running/2 rounded down) + Bonuses - Penalties (see [[9. Movement and Distance]])
## Costs
[[5. Skills]]  - are progressed by paying increased 2/+4/+6/+8/+10 price for each update.

Domains -  such as #Spellcraft or [[1. Martial Domains]] like One-Handed Weapons Domain are Skills following different progression rules.

To progress domains you need to purchase spells (for Spellcraft) and Perks (for both).
Some perks apply to multiple domains. When learning such a perk, choose which domain receives the XP (similar to choosing attributes)

 The progression becomes:
 - Regular Skills: Direct XP purchase (2/4/6/8/10 or similar)
 - Domains: Progressed by learning domain abilities (suck as perks and spells)
   - #Spellcraft Domain: 10/+20/+30/+40/+50 via learning spells and as mentioned in [[6. Magic System]] are gated by skills.
   - [[1. Martial Domains]]: 5/+10/+15/+20/+25 via learning combat techniques/perks.
