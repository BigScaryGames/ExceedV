# 3. Creating a Character

## Step 1: Concept
Decide on a name and concept for your character.

## Step 2: Starting XP
GM declates starting Experience Points (XP) in two categories:

| XP Type       | Used For                                                                                             |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Combat XP** | HP (Conditioning perks), combat skills, combat-related perks as well as Spellcraft perks and spells. |
| **Skill XP**  | Social, knowledge, crafting, wilderness skills, and related perks                                    |

## Step 3: Spend XP
Spend XP on skills, perks, and spells. Each purchase shows (Attribute1) or (Attribute1/Attribute2) indicating which attributes can benefit. When making a purchase, you choose one of the listed attributes to apply the XP toward. When attributes reach tier thresholds (10/30/60/100/150), you gain +1 to that attribute, up to +5.

## Step 4: Calculate Action Points

| Stat | Calculation |

| **HP** | See [[3.2 HP And Wounds]] |

## Progression Costs

### Skills
[[5. Skills]] - progressed by paying increased 2/+4/+6/+8/+10 XP for each level.

### Domains
Domains (such as Spellcraft or Martial) follow different progression rules - they are progressed by learning domain abilities (perks and spells).

| Domain         | Progression        | Method                                                     |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Spellcraft** | 10/+20/+30/+40/+50 | Learning spells (gated by skills, see [[6. Magic System]]) |
| **Martial**    | 10/+20/+30/+40/+50 | Learning combat perks                                      |

Some perks apply to multiple domains. When learning such a perk, choose which domain receives the XP (similar to choosing attributes).
