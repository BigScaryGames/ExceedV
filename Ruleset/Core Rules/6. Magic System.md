# 6. Magic System

> **Note:** The trait system for basic defenses (Endure/Dodge/Block/Parry) hasn't been fully developed yet, and the spells are in their earliest generic version. Some parts are placeholders.

## Core Principles

Magic can only be cast by [[Mage]]s - people with inherited or acquired magical ability.

If you want to be a [[Mage]], take the perk (requires GM permission) and select your origin spell (Basic).

Magic in Exceed can be #Attuned or not:
- **#Attuned magic:** Uses the Limit system, is persistent, requires no actions to maintain
- **Active spells:** Require a [Casting Check]: `Spellcraft + Wit + Bonuses` vs DC `[8 + Tier × 2]`

There is no spell resource in Exceed.

# Spells

Spells that deal damage (unless otherwise noted) scale with number of dice equal to your Spellcraft.

## Spell Shapes

> **Designer Note:** Spell AP cost, distance, and modifiers will be completely remade in playtest 5 or 6. Right now magic acts more like a proof of concept.

- **Increase reach:** +1 AP per 10m
- **Increase targets:** +2 AP per additional target
