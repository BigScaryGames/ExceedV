## Description
Everyone wants to bend reality to their will. Unlike most, you can, because you are a mage.

Perhaps you were trained by a journeyman or master mage, paid to try to awaken your talent. Or maybe, like most mages, during a pivotal moment in your life, your talent awakened.

You might have been a child lost in the darkness who summoned light or adapted your eyes to see in it, a pilgrim whose legs were so tired that all you wanted was for your backpack to become weightless or the mud less clingy, or maybe you saw your loved ones dying and willed their wounds to stop bleeding.
