## **Description**
When you select this perk, select attribute it is going to work with.

When **surrounded by or adjacent to** an element, or if you were attacked by a spell with that **elemental trait** on the previous turn, the **AP cost of casting a spell of that same element is reduced by 1** (minimum 1).

### **Mechanics**

A character is considered **surrounded or adjacent to an element** if any of the following apply:

- **Environmental effects** influence the area — such as howling winds, lightning storms, heavy rain, or snowfall.
- **Local elemental sources** are present in sufficient quantity to deal damage — such as torches, rivers, burning oil, or broken ice. _(Air and earth doesn't count.)_
- Using such elements as the focus of your magic may **consume or alter** them — e.g. fire may extinguish, water may be displaced, etc.
