## Description
As a mage exposed to transmutation magic and teleportation effects, your body and essence have been repeatedly subjected to magical alteration. Whether through experimental self-transformation, teleportation mishaps, or defensive training against hostile magic, you've developed a unique resistance to unwanted magical changes. Your magical nature has learned to recognize and resist foreign transmutation attempts. At mastery, your essence is so accustomed to magical forces that it instinctively rejects transmutation and forced displacement that you don't control.
