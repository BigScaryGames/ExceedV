## Description
Whether through necessity or deliberate training, you've spent extensive time in freezing conditions. Your body has learned to conserve heat more efficiently, your blood flows better in cold temperatures, and you've developed techniques for maintaining function when others would succumb to hypothermia. Ice baths, winter survival training, or years in arctic climates have transformed your relationship with cold. At mastery, you move through blizzards as easily as others walk through spring rain.
