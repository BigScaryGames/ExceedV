## Description
Standing beneath a waterfall, feeling the relentless pressure trying to knock you down, you learn to root yourself against overwhelming force. Through countless hours of resisting the current's push and pull, your body learns to distribute force and maintain balance against displacement. At mastery, you stand as firm as the stones beneath the waterfall itself, unmoved by forces that would sweep others away.
