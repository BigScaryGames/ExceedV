## Description
Every scar has a story. Every near-death experience has taught you something about survival. Through combat, you've learned your body's limits and how to push beyond them. You know how wounds heal, which injuries are merely painful versus truly dangerous, and how to work with healers to maximize recovery. Your flesh bears testimony to battles survived, and that experience makes you more resilient. At the peak of this conditioning, your body has been broken and remade so many times that it knows instinctively how to survive and recover.
