## Short Description
Loyal follower with enhanced mental resistance and leader protection.

## Effect
You are close to The Leader and your oath is strong. Any attempt to mind control or coerce you (unless rolled by the leader) is rolled with a disadvantage. You gain "Protect the Leader" reaction (allowing you to take the damage of the leader if adjacent). When you are driven into fervor your attack increases by 2 and defense decreases by 3.
