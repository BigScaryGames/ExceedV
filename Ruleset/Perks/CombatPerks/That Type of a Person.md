## Short Description
Rush to protect downed allies, taking their attacks.

## Effect
When an ally is downed within your Speed distance, you run to that space as a free action. This movement doesn't provoke reactions. When you stand on your downed ally's space, all offensive actions including AOE directed at the ally will be directed at you instead. You can't leave the space until the end of the combat, or you seeing the ally losing unconscious condition.

## Description
They call you selfless, but maybe deep inside you are just too selfish to lose what you care about the most.
