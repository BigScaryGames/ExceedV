## Short Description
Failed Deduce checks provide conflicting information instead of nothing.

## Effect
When you fail a [Deduce] check, the GM provides two pieces of information: one true, one false. You don't know which is which.

## Description
Your mind fills gaps in knowledge with half-remembered details, conflicting sources, and plausible theories. Sometimes this leads to brilliant insights, sometimes to spectacular mistakes. The false information should be plausible and based on real misconceptions or incomplete understanding.
