## Description
[Decades ago the Elzmeer academy student developed this ritual to clean the dorm from pests, It was so efficient, that he dropped out of the academy, took a loan and opened his own business. Sadly, it was too good, and the city was cleansed of pests in a year. To avoid bankruptcy he lowered the spell intensity to just shoo the critters away into other houses. That wasn't enough to save his failing business venture. Thus, the reverse of the ritual was invented. It led to his execution a few weeks later.
