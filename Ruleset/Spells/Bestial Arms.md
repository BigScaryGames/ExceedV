## Description
[Basic transformation step on a way to become a furry beast. The utility of this spell is overrated, as a dagger is more versatile.  Authors note: I've only seen druids and furry pervs use this spell, and in Elzmeer we don't teach druidism. This spell won't count for exam qualifications.]
