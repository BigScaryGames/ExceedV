Design descisions.
1. How do I categorize magic to make narrow mages?
   Do I even do that?
2. option 1: goal - Healer mage, Ward mage, blaster mage, utility mage, specific energy mage. Or i can make magic more full with traits.
   

## Spell shapes
Increase reach: +1AP per 10m.(make this progressive)
Increase number of targets: +2AP per target.

**Designer note** - the spells AP cost, distance and modifiers will be completely remade in the playtest 5 or 6 stage. Right now magic  acts more like a proof of concept.
~~Make cone - Increase tier by 1/2/3 for 3m/6m/10m.~~
~~Make sphere/emanation - increase tier by 1/2/3 for radius of 2/4/6~~
~~Make ray - increase Tier by 2. Spend 2AP after hit, to attack the same target again.~~
~~Make chain - chain from one target to another until the first successful block or parry.~~
~~Make Barrier - increase tier by~~
