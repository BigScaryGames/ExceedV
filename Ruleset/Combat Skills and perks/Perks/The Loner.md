Fight alone with enhanced capabilities but no allies.

It's you against the world. When fighting alone you start with +2 AP. You count no-one as your allies. You can't be a willing target for a Team Ritual, if you participate in one you lose the perk. (you keep their effect on the stats though). Retraining from this perk requires GM permission.
