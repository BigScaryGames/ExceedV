# Medical Treatment and Wound Consequences V3
## Core Wound System

Getting into a fight is a dangerous endeavor, and you haven't emerged from it unscathed.
1. Roll the [Consequence roll]
2. Write down the lasting consequence on your character sheet and mark 1 wound.
3. Remove the mark from the wound and the consequence after the rest period. See [[3.3 Rest and Recovery#Rest and Treatment Conditions]] for conditions based rest time modification.
4. GM can lower the effects of the consequence at certain times during the  rest. E.g. Head 3 to Head 2 after halfway through recovery, or Limb 2 to Limb 1 etc.
5. If re-injured GM decides the severity level to reopen it.

## Consequence Roll
[Consequence roll] - 1d100 - (Remaining Wounds Ã— 10) on the Consequences Table, if the attack forcing the consequence was a **Critical Hit**, Add +10 to the consequence roll.
## Terms

**Treatment DC:** 11 + Double of sum of all wounds severities.

**Limb Determination:** When a consequence affects a limb, roll 1d4 - on 1-2 it's an arm, on 3-4 it's a leg

# Treatment Rules
## Treatment Methods
**First Aid:** Medical skill check against Treatment DC

## Re-injury, Recovery, Permanent effects.
**Natural Recovery**
In case when appropriate treatment was not provided, but escalation didn't occur, the time to recover increases by 1 step.
i.e. 1 day for minor, Tendays for Moderate, Season for Serious, and a ten Seasons for a critical. GM decides on the permanent effects.

**Re-injury Penalty:** If wounded again before completing rest, previous consequences reopen alongside new ones

**Multiple Wounds:** Characters can suffer multiple consequences simultaneously, when treating a wound you treat one of the wounds.

**Permanent Effects:** Severity 3 consequences may leave permanent effects even after successful treatment, up to GM.
