# Medical Treatment and Wound Consequences V3
## Core Wound System

Getting into a fight is a dangerous endevor, and you haven't emerged from it unscathed.
1. Roll the [Consequence roll]
2. Write down the lasting consequence on your character sheet and mark 1 wound.
3. Remove the mark from the wound and the consequence after the rest period. GM can lower the effects of the consequence at setrain times during the  rest. E.g. Head 3 to Head 2 after halfway through recovery, or Limb 2 to Limb 1 etc.
4. If reinjured GM decides the severity level to reopen it.

## Consequence Roll
[Consequence roll] - 1d100 - (Remaining Wounds Ã— 10) on the Consequences Table, if the attack forcing the consequence was a **Critical Hit**, Add +10 to the consequence roll.
## Terms
**Bleeding:** Wounds cause bleeding X equal to highest wound severity level (0-3 damage per turn until treated).

**Natural Bleeding Cessation** At the end of each turn (or every minute out of combat), characters with bleeding wounds roll flat 2d10 vs 11+Bleeding level, reducing the severity by 1 or 2 on a critical.

**Treatment DC:** 11 + Double of sum of all wounds severities.

**Limb Determination:** When a consequence affects a limb, roll 1d4 - on 1-2 it's an arm, on 3-4 it's a leg

# Treatment Rules
## Treatment Methods
**First Aid:** Medical skill check against Treatment DC
- **Trained:** 4 actions to perform
- **Untrained:** 3 rounds, cannot be performed during combat
- *Note: Exiting combat to perform first aid prevents dodging, blocking, and parrying*
- **Effect:** Stops bleeding, prevents or delays escalation

**Treat Wounds:** Medical skill check requiring training and appropriate tools
- **Base time:** 1 minute
- **Enhanced treatment:** +2 bonus (10 minutes) or +4 bonus (1 hour)
- **Effect:** Required for Severity 1-2 consequences to heal

**Surgery:** Requires Medical skill 3+ and appropriate surgical tools
- **Base Time:** 1 hour
- **Enhanced treatment:** +2 for 4 hours, +4 for 8 hours
- **Effect:** Required for Severity 3 consequences to heal

**Magical Healing:** Some magical healing can substitute for appropriate mundane treatment methods, but is mainly used to restore HP.

## Reinjury, Recovery, Permanent effects.
**Natural Recovery**
In case when appropriate treatment was not provided, but the bleeding has stopped and escalation didn't occur, the time to recover increases by 1 step.
i.e. 1 day for minor, 1d6 days for Moderate, 1d6 weeks for Serious, 1d6 months for critical. GM decides on the permanent effects.

**Re-injury Penalty:** If wounded again before completing rest, previous consequences reopen alongside new ones

**Multiple Wounds:** Characters can suffer multiple consequences simultaneously, when treating a wound you treat one of the wounds.

**Permanent Effects:** Severity 3 consequences may leave permanent effects even after successful treatment, up to GM.
