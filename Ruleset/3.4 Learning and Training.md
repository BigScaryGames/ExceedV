# **Learning and Training**

#Variant_Rule

Learning and Training require spending **downtime** to convert **XP** into **skills, perks, or spells**.  
Training time depends on the **quality of trainers, facilities, and materials** (manuals, spellbooks, etc.) versus the **tier** of what’s being learned.

The higher the tier of a skill or perk, the greater the requirements — what counts as “good” for Tier 2 may be “poor” for Tier 4.

A **Day** of training equals **4 Shifts**, and you cannot train effectively for more than that per Day.

| **Training Quality** | **Description**                                                                              | **Time per XP**  | **Examples**                                                               |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **None**             | Unguided practice. You’re experimenting, reverse-engineering, or imitating what you’ve seen. | **1 Tenday +**   | Swinging a sword alone, reinventing lost magic, trial-and-error tinkering. |
| **Poor**             | Limited guidance — a bad manual, distracted mentor, or work-time practice.                   | **2 Days / XP**  | Learning from scraps, incomplete notes, or an overworked guildmaster.      |
| **Normal**           | Competent teacher _or_ reliable manual/facility. Standard conditions.                        | **1 Day / XP**   | Practicing with an instructor, studying at a temple or guild hall.         |
| **Good**             | Excellent teacher, superb manual, or both combined. Ideal conditions.                        | **1 Shift / XP** | Training with a master using a complete library, lab, or dojo.             |

# Note To GMs
This rule is situational. It might not work at all during your campaigns so feel free to cut if off, its a variant rule designed for campaigns that utilize downtime. 
This rule is to be tracked loosely in favor of players, as this is just a design tool to sustain the coherence of the narrative. 
If players did a heist or fought a fight you might allow them just to straight up level up a skill or gain a perk.  You can even allow a XP debt or grant perks with #Instant trait in debt.


This also gives you a tool to slow down super one dimensional progression, as higher (3+) tiers of abilities will require a manual and/or guidance. This is an aid to **you** GM to create narrative hooks for players to fight an ancient lich to gain his spell-book, or participate in an bankruptcy auction where a fabled manual of a greatsword master is going to be present. This also will increase the weight of organizations and mentors in your game.
