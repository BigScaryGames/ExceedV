## Rest and Recovery

A **Night’s Rest** consists of **3 or more Shifts** (~8 hours Earth time).  
Each character requires at least **3 Shifts of sleep** within a Day to recover normally.

### Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue
- If a character goes a full **Day** without sleep, they gain **1 level of Fatigue**, plus an additional **+1** for every **5 Shifts** (~12 hours Earth time) thereafter.  
- Fatigue from **lack of sleep** cannot be removed until the character completes a **full extended rest** of **3 + Fatigue Level Shifts**.  
- Magical or alchemical solutions may delay the effects or temporarily reduce Fatigue, but they do **not remove** accumulated fatigue.

### Recovering from Fatigue
- Each **Rest Shift** removes **1 level of Fatigue** (except fatigue from sleep deprivation).  
- **Comfortable rest**, proper food, or **medical care** may remove an **additional level** of Fatigue per Night’s Rest (GM discretion).  
- Characters cannot recover from Fatigue while **marching, exploring, or in combat**.

### Rest and Treatment Conditions
In [[4.2 Wounds And Consequences#Severity Levels]], each consequence lists the **Unmodified Rest** required for recovery.  
These times are adjusted by the **conditions of rest and treatment** below.  
See [[9.1 Time and Travel#Exceed TIME]] for time magnitude reference.

| **Condition** | **Description**                                                                            | **Effect on Recovery**  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| **Terrible**  | Exposure, stress, hunger, or constant danger. No rest possible.                            | **+1 Magnitude slower** |
| **Poor**      | Unsafe or uncomfortable rest: cold, heat, constant movement, or lack of food.              | **×2 slower**           |
| **Normal**    | Safe, calm environment with basic rest, food, and shelter.                                 | **Base recovery**       |
| **Fine**      | Attentive care: a trained medic (Skill 3) *or* Tier 2 magical aid.                         | **½ time**              |
| **Great**     | Combined expert medical (Skill 3) **and** magical (Tier 2) care, e.g. hospital, temple.    | **1 Magnitude faster**  |
| **Superb**    | Exceptional conditions: master healer (Skill 4+) *and* Tier 4+ magic or advanced facility. | **2 Magnitudes faster** |

During recovery, characters may engage in light downtime activities such as **learning or income work**,  
as long as the GM judges these do not meaningfully interrupt rest.
