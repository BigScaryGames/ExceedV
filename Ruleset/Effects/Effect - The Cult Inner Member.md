You are close to The Leader and your oath is strong. Any attempt to mind control or coerce you (unless by the leader) is rolled with disadvantage. You gain "Protect the Leader" reaction (allowing you to take damage for the leader if adjacent). When driven into fervor, your attack increases by +2 and defense decreases by -3.
