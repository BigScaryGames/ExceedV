You learn to channel magical energy through your shield, creating a defensive layer covering you. You can attempt to Block against Physical or Energy Line, Cone, Burst, and Ray type spells and magical effects (like dragon's breath or fireball). If you have Guardian Aura, the bonus applies to your allies as well.
