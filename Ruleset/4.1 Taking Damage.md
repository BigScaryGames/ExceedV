# Taking Damage and Consequences

**Half-Health:** First time you fall below 50% from a hit of your HealthÂ during combat roll 2d10 on the [Consequence Table].

**0 Health:** **Each** time your Health reaches or goes bellow 0 from a lethal hit roll  [Consequence Roll], and mark 1 wound (reducing max Health and Stamina until fully recovered).
### Getting below 0 HP and Death
When below 0 Health you need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC of your highest treatment DC wound to stay conscious at the end of each of your turns.

Each lethal hit you take in this state makes you roll on the consequence table.
Each non-lethal hit you take in this state makes you roll Endure against the hit to stay conscious.

When below negative full Health - you fall unconscious. Unless the attack was nonlethal you also need to roll Endure vs Treatment DC to stay alive at the end of each of your turns.

If your wounds would exceed max wounds you die.
## Nonlethal and DoT
- **Non-lethal attacks:** if the attack forcing the consequence was non-lethal Roll 2d10 instead of 1d100.
- If the damage forcing the consequence was **persistent DoT** - don't roll for the consequence.
