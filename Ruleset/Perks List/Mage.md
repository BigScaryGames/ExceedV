## Description

Everyone wants to bend reality to their will. Unlike most, you can, because you are a mage.

Perhaps you were trained by a journeyman or master mage, paid to try to awaken your talent. Or maybe, like most mages, during a pivotal moment in your life, your talent awakened.

You might have been a child lost in the darkness who summoned light or adapted your eyes to see in it, a pilgrim whose legs were so tired that all you wanted was for your backpack to become weightless or the mud less clingy, or maybe you saw your loved ones dying and willed their wounds to stop bleeding.

## Mechanics

- Select a Tier 0 spell. Add it to your repertoire. This spell doesn't contribute to attribute advancement.
- You unlock Tier 0 spells for learning.
- You can learn [[Team Ritual]] in one day with written guidance or in one shift with help from someone who knows it. This is highly common knowledge.
* This perk requires no time to learn, requires GM permission as per #GM trait and the GM may decide to grant it to you at any given time up to his discretion, bending the reality.
* You can select this perk as a part of a background, but to unlock it in a controlled state GM might require Magical Theory 1/Theology 1 and a magical instructor (tier 2 or higher, at least legally).
