## 1. Skill Distribution and Logic

### Skill Levels and Dice Progression

| Skill Level | Dice Formula | Max Roll | Average |
| ----------- | ------------ | -------- | ------- |
| 1           | 1d4          | 4        | 2.5     |
| 2           | 1d4+1        | 5        | 3.5     |
| 3           | 1d4+2        | 6        | 4.5     |
| 4           | 2d4          | 8        | 5.0     |
| 5           | 1d4+1d6      | 10       | 6.0     |
| 6           | 2d6          | 12       | 7.0     |
| n (uneven)  | 1dN-1, 1dN+1 | 2n       | n+1     |
| n+1         | 2dN          | 2n       | n+1     |

### Key Design Principles

- **Skill Average / Skill DC = Skill Level + 1** (for skills 4+)
- Linear scaling from avrg of 2 to 20,
- Higher skills compress attribute advantages,
- System supports skills beyond level 6 with continued dice progression 13-18 using d12 +N

### Competitive Balance Results

**Equal Skill Contests:** ~37-44% attacker advantage (accounting for ties) **+1 Skill Advantage:** ~50-63% win rate **+2 Skill Advantage:** ~65-81% win rate

## 2. Contested and Uncontested Checks

### Contested Checks (Opposed Rolls)

**Method:** Both participants roll their skill dice + attribute modifier. Higher total wins.

**Example:**

- Attacker: Skill 5 (1d4+1d6) + Control 2 = 2-12 range
- Defender: Skill 4 (2d4) + Control 0 = 2-8 range
Attacker considers successful if the result of Attack Roll is >= Defense Roll.

Critical Results:
Attacker takes the smallest die of the defender, and vice versa. 
If Difference is >

### Uncontested Checks 
Uncontested checks follow a similar structure:
Success>= SkillDice+AttributeModifier+Bonuses Vs DC.
