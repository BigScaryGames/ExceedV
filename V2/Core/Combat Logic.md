## Attack & Defense rolls

- **Attack roll** = _Weapon Skill dice_ + **attribute** (CN for agile weapons; PW for heavy; tag per weapon).
    
- **Defense: choose one**
    
    - **Dodge** = _Dodge Skill dice_ + **CN** (**capped by armor’s Control Cap**).
        
    - **Parry** = _Weapon Parry Skill dice_ + **CN** (no armor cap).
        
    - **Block** = _Shield Skill dice_ + **PW** (no armor cap).
        

Both sides roll. If **Attack > Defense**, it’s a **hit**; crit per competitive rolls resolution logic.
You can use PW for heavy weapon attacks, but when parrying it still uses CN.
