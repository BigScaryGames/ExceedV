**Temporary Wounds**
- **Cannot recover while any Serious Wounds remain**
- When no Serious Wounds exist:
  - Full recovery after scene
  - Half recovery during short breather (10+ minutes)
  - Can be restored by certain abilities

**Serious Wounds**
- Each Serious Wound takes 1 week to heal naturally
- Can be accelerated using medical treatment, potions, and healing abilities
- Medical treatment can convert Serious Wounds to Temporary Wounds
- **Must be healed before Temporary Wounds can recover**

**Healing Limitations**
- Medical treatments have daily limits per patient
- Potions have daily limits per person
- Natural healing cannot be accelerated without intervention

#### Example Recovery

- Alternatively, medical treatment could convert the Serious Wound to Temporary, allowing normal rest recovery
