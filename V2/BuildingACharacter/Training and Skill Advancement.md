Characters grow through experience, but mastery takes time. Even if you have the points to spend, integrating new knowledge and skills requires dedicated in-world downtime.

### **Spending Points**

When you spend points to raise a skill, you must also spend **training time** before the improvement takes effect.

**Training Time:**
- **1 Point = 1 Day** of dedicated practice or study. (8h) (presuming either access to literature, training grounds, sparring partners or to performing the craft as an occupation.) 
- Time Cost can be cut down by access to particularly efficient Facilities or Trainers of an appropriate tier or above.

**Example:**

- A skill increase from **15 â†’ 16** costs 7 point and requires **7 days** of downtime. A full workweek can fulfill the point growth. A good library could cut that time to a time up to GM's discretion.
- Raising StrikingPW [10] would require 10 days, but could be cut down by a presence of a healer, growth potions and good equipment.
