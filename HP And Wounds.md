## Hit Points and Wounds System

### Base Health
All human characters start with:
- **2 Max Wounds**  
- **5 HP per Wound** (spieces dependent, will be 5 for the time being)
- **Total Starting HP: 10**

### HP Calculation
**Total HP = Max Wounds × (5 + Armor Bonus+Endurance)+ExtraHP**
  - Stamina HP: First half (recovers quickly)
  - Health HP: Second half (real damage)
On stamina HP deplition roll on [Minor conditions table] according to the table rules.
On health HP deplition roll on [Major conditions table] accoring to the table rules, fall unconcious and mark off 1 wound. If you exceed Max Wounds - you die.


### Increasing Hit Points

#### Perk: Tough (Endurance/Will)
- **Cost:** MaxWounds * XP per HP
- **Consolidation:** Every 5 HP (change with race HP in later interations) purchased becomes +1 Wound.  The new wound gains full armor bonus like existing wounds
- **Example:** Character with +2 Armor has 4 extra HP
  - Current: 2 wounds × 7 HP + 4 HP = 18 total HP  
  - After buying 1 more HP: 3 wounds × 7 HP = 21 total HP

### Progression Examples
- **Starting:** 2 wounds × 5 HP = 10 total HP (12 with armor 1)
- **+1 Wound (10 XP):** 3 wounds × 5 HP = 15 total HP (21 with armor 2)
- **+2 Wounds (20 XP):** 4 wounds × 5 HP = 20 total HP (32 with armor 3)
