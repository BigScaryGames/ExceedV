### Weapon Traits
**Agile**: Weapons with this trait are exempt from the #RepeatedAttackPenalty 
**Aim Increment X**: Using the Aim action extends your effective range to X squares, negating range penalties for that attack. You can use multiple Aim actions to extend range further, with each Aim action adding X squares to your effective range up to 3 times.
**Concealed**: Weapon provides a +2 bonus to Spy checks to hide it on your person, and is undetectable without inspection.
**Conduit**: This weapon is or is embedded with magical conduit allowing channeling of spells. 
**Double**: This weapon counts as different hands for #RepeatedAttackPenalty purposes, allowing two attacks without the penalty. 
**Heavy**: Weapons with this trait incur a -2 penalty on the second and subsequent attacks, regardless of which hand made the first attack. 
**Long Reach**: This weapon can target enemies 2-3 squares away. If the weapon also has Reach, you must spend an action to switch grips to change between reach distances.
**Nonlethal**: This weapon deals nonlethal damage, making all wounds they take temporary.
**Quick Drawn**: You can draw this weapon as part of making an attack with it. 
**Reach**: This weapon can target enemies 1-2 squares away.

##  #Ranged_Weapons(WIP)

**Note**: Bow damage varies based on Power requirements. An unfit bow (one in which you lack power) will have a minus to hit equal to Power-Power.req, 
a fit or lower power req. bow one will do extra damage equal to it's Power requirement. 

Range Increment - For weapons without the Aim trait (such as thrown weapons), range increments are equal to the weapon's Range value. For weapons with Aim X trait Range Increment = X.

| Weapon   | DMG         | Power Req | Properties              | Crit  |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ----------------------- | ----- |
| Shortbow | 4+Power Req | -1 to 5   | Aim 10, Range 5,        | Pin 1 |
| Longbow  | 5+Power Req | 0 to 5    | Aim 20, Large, Range 2, | Pin 2 |
