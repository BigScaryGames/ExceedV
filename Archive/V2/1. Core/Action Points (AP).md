### **Overview**

Action Points represent how many things a character can do in a combat round. They measure **tempo** — how quickly you can act — and are determined by your speed (CN) or mental focus (FC).

---
## **Calculating AP**

**Base AP:** 5  
**Bonus AP:** `floor(max(CN, FC) ÷ 2)`

- **CN (Control):** Physical agility, reflexes, precision.
    
- **FC (Focus):** Mental speed, reaction time, sustained concentration.
    

**Example:**  
CN 4, FC 2 → max is 4 → 4 ÷ 2 = 2 → 5 + 2 = **7 AP**.

AP range for most characters: **4–7**.
## **AP Costs**
