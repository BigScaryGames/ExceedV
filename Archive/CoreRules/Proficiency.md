The game uses Domains for proficiency, which are the combination of trades used for certain occupations and usually taught together, like professions. Different campaigns result in different domains selected by the GM. For the MVP, all the listed domains will be used.

## Proficiency level.

+0 Novice (Unpaid Student)- you have basic knowledge or ability in a skill domain - you understand how to attempt a task in the domain and can perform basic tasks without penalty.

+1 Trainee (Junior 1)- You have a fair amount of practice experience and can tackle moderately challenging tasks and earn income from the craft.

+2 Apprentice (Junior 2)- Your skills in the domain are vast, allowing you to perform all non-specialized tasks of the domain.

+3 Journeyman- (Middle 1) You know the domain well, and you can reliably attempt basic specialized tasks. Like spell creation for Arcane specialists or performing an exorcism, or conducting a not very complex surgery.  
Â 

Proficiency levels of High Journeyman and higher are locked behind specializations, also having up to +3 limit, which is added on top of domain proficiency, giving a maximum of +6 at the end, depicting the level of Grand Master.

Each domain has specializations - some pre-made, some not (require GM permission).

**For reasons of playtesting MVP 1, proficiency can be upgraded to up to +3.**
