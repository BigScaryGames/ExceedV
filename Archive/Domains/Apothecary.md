## Domain Abilities

### Level 1

- **Herbalist's Eye** - You can identify medicinal and poisonous plants in the wild without rolling. When foraging for herbs, you find twice the normal amount and know their properties immediately.
- **First Aid** - You can provide first aid that restores 1 + Apothecary modifier HP without using supplies. The target should have taken that damage during the last hour, or heal 1 HP instead of 1 + Apothecary modifier. This can be done once per person per day.
- **Licensed Healer (Status)** - You are a certified medical practitioner. You can legally practice medicine, earn income through healing services, and gain preferential treatment from nobles and officials who value medical expertise.
- **Poison Resistance** - Through constant exposure to small doses, you have +2 to all saves against poisons and can identify poisons by smell/taste without risk.

### Level 2

- **Master Brewer** - During downtime, you can craft basic healing potions, antidotes, and mild poisons. Crafting time is halved and you can substitute common herbs for expensive components. When substituting, the brews have no shelf life and wane in a day to a lower grade.
- **Surgeon's Precision** (Requirement: First Aid) - You can perform complex medical procedures that restore 1 + Apothecary modifier HP. Remove diseases, treat severe injuries that would normally cause permanent damage, and provide long-term healing that restores 1 + Apothecary modifier HP per day for a week or until the target gets injured again.
- **Anatomical Knowledge** - You can identify target's weaknesses if it possesses them by rolling Apothecary.
- **Plague Ward** - You can create protective salves and treatments. Anyone you treat becomes immune to diseases for 24 hours, and you can safely handle diseased patients without risk of infection.

### Level 3

- **Royal Physician** (Requirement: Licensed Healer, be appointed to a noble court) - Your reputation grants you audiences with nobility, protection under medical immunity laws, and access to rare ingredients through royal connections.
- **Elixir Mastery** - You can craft temporary enhancement elixirs that boost attributes by +1 for one hour, create powerful healing draughts that restore full HP, or brew lethal poisons that ignore some resistances.
- **Life and Death** - Once per day, you can revive someone who died within the last minute through a combination of surgery and alchemical treatments (1 minute of work, DC determined by GM).
- **Toxicologist** (Requirement: Poison Resistance) - You are immune to all non-magical poisons and can create specialized poisons tailored to specific creature types. Your poisons can cause specific effects like paralysis, sleep, or temporary attribute damage.
