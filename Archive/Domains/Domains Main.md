## Trades

Trade is a narrow skillset or occupation. Knowing a trade like singing, playing musical instruments, or cooking at a level that can allow gathering income, but is more likely used for roleplay.  
Trade gets attached to a domain (sometimes with one of the domains), increasing alongside it. So, for example, adding singing to Influencer or painting to the Craftsman will cost **4 point**s. Same with a Parish Priest Trade to Theologian.  
Some trades may allow very limited specialized actions at a lower level of complexity, but out of the scope of initial playtesting.

The status of the trade and positions are not yet turned into numbers, so we ignore them.

Pickpocketing is a trade like lockpicking, which can be added to Spy Line or Underworlder.

Trades that don't require deep knowledge and usually don't require checks, like cooking, can be written in separately.
