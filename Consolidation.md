Passives increasing secondary attributes can be refunded when updating the attribute.
Example - Character with FC0 and IQ0 and 'Extra Limit 2' has 20 points to spend.
his current limit is 3+Iq0+fc0+2=5
He can decide to increase his IQ to 2 by consolidating the extra limit 2 into 20 points, adding with his 20 points and getting and IQ2 which will affect all aspects of IQ.
As a result his Limit will be the same 3+IQ2+FC0=5.
He could also instead make it into FC2 or IQ1 and FC1, or he could increase a stat as a whole, (which would also increase his limit) or directly increase extra limit to +4.
