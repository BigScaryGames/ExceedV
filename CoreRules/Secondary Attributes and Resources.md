## Health System

**Hit points** in this game represent the overall character toughness, coming from his strength of mind (Focus), body (Health) and protection ([[Armour]]). It is split into thresholds of temporary and serious wounds.

**[[Temporary Wounds]]** represent fatigue, bruises, minor cuts, and the accumulated stress of combat. You're hurt and tired, but nothing that won't heal with rest and recuperation. These wounds reflect your body's ability to absorb punishment without lasting damage. 
**[[Serious Wounds]]** are debilitating injuries - broken bones, deep cuts, internal trauma, or magical corruption that requires proper medical attention. Each serious wound impairs your abilities as pain and injury take their toll, representing genuine physical trauma that mere rest cannot heal.

**[[Consequences]]**  Falling in combat to a lethal attack leads to a consequence from the [[Consequences]] table. (Outside MVP scope.)

## Health and Damage

### Calculating Your Health

**Base Resilience** = Focus + Health + 2
**Damage Threshold** = Base Resilience + Armor Bonus
**Total Wounds** = 2 + Health 
**Total HP** = Damage Threshold Ã— Total Wounds 

Combatants are not expected to fight without their main armor, but if they are remove AB*wounds from the wound pull, and lower each threshold by Armor bonus. 

### Damage Zones

**Temporary Wounds** (First half of wounds, rounded down)
- No penalties to actions
- Recover  after scene or with abilities.

**Serious Wounds** (Remaining wounds)  
- Each level: -1, -2, -3... penalty to all actions
- Require medical treatment
- At Max Wounds, character is incapacitated(unless stated otherwise)

**Fatigue:**
Each time gaining a level of fatigue leads to lowering max HP by 1 row of temporary wounds.
Character can become fatigued up to level of Temporary wounds, falling unconscious if pushed beyond that level.


#### Example
Health 2, Focus 1, Armor Bonus 3:
- Base Resilience: 5 (vs mental/necrotic)
- Damage Threshold: 8 (vs physical, HP per wound)
- Total Wounds: 4
- Total HP: 32
- Superficial Wounds: 2 (no penalty)
- Serious Wounds: 2 (penalties -1, -2)


### Recovery

**Temporary Wounds**
- **Cannot recover while any Serious Wounds remain**
- When no Serious Wounds exist:
  - Full recovery after scene
  - Half recovery during short breather (10+ minutes)
  - Can be restored by certain abilities

**Serious Wounds**
- Each Serious Wound takes 1 week to heal naturally
- Can be accelerated using medical treatment, potions, and healing abilities
- Medical treatment can convert Serious Wounds to Temporary Wounds
- **Must be healed before Temporary Wounds can recover**

**Healing Limitations**
- Medical treatments have daily limits per patient
- Potions have daily limits per person
- Natural healing cannot be accelerated without intervention

#### Example Recovery
Character with 2 Temporary Wounds and 1 Serious Wound:
- **Cannot rest to recover the 2 Temporary Wounds**
- Must receive medical treatment to heal the Serious Wound first
- After Serious Wound is healed, Temporary Wounds recover normally
- Alternatively, medical treatment could convert the Serious Wound to Temporary, allowing normal rest recovery
