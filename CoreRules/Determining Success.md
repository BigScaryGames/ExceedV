All challenges in the game use the same core mechanic: **1d10-1d10 + Attribute + Skill â‰¥ DC**.

### **Basic Resolution**

- Roll two ten-sided dice (1d10-1d10), using d100 for the first die and d10 for the second, counting 0 as 10, getting the dice result
- Add your relevant Attribute modifier
- Add your Skill rating (0 for untrained skills)
- Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (DC) or Defense Class

**Critical Results**

- **Critical Success**: Exceed the target by 5 or more
- **Critical Failure**: Miss the target by 5 or more
- Critical results create dramatic outcomes beyond success or a failure

Circumstance modifiers are applied to the DC, not the roll.

- Bonuses from items, spells, and stances apply to the skills and modifiers
- Checks targeting attributes (climbing, remembering, swimming, balancing, etc.) use doubled attribute + dice result

Tasks with an overall DC of -2 or lower don't require checks when not in combat.

- **DC -4 - Trivial**: Tasks requiring no skill or aptitude. Requesting roll only when negative circumstances are stacking up.
- **DC -2 - Simple**: Basic tasks requiring minimal effort or skill
- **DC 0 - Routine**: Standard tasks that individuals with basic proficiency can accomplish reliably
- **DC 2 - Moderate**: Requires a fair amount of skill or effort
- **DC 4 - Challenging**: Tasks that pose a significant challenge, requiring skilled individuals
- **DC 6 - Difficult**: Hard tasks that demand a high level of expertise
- **DC 8 - Formidable**: Very challenging tasks that test the limits of abilities
- **DC 10 - Daunting**: Extremely difficult tasks achievable only by the most skilled
