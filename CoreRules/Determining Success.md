All challenges in the game use the same core mechanic: 1d10-1d10 + Attribute + Skill  â‰¥ DC.

- Roll two ten-sided dice (1d10-1d10), using d100 for first and d10 for second, counting 0 as 10
    
- Add your relevant Attribute modifier
    
- Add your Skill rating (0 for untrained skills)
    
- Compare the total to the Difficulty Class (DC) or Defence Class(DC)
    
- Rolling doubles turns success into critical success and failure into critical failure
    

Circumstance modifiers are applied to the DC, not the roll.

- Bonuses from Items and spells, stances apply to the skills and modifiers.
    
- Checks targeting attributes: climbing, remembering, swimming, balancing, etc., use doubled attribute+1d10-1d10.
    

Tasks of -2 or lower overall DC don't require checks under normal conditions.

- **DC 8 - Formidable**: Very challenging tasks that test the limits of abilities
    
- **DC 10 - Daunting**: Extremely difficult tasks achievable only by the most skilled
