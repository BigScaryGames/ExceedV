**Gaining Fatigue:**
- **Marching over 8 hours**: Gain 1 fatigue level for each additional 2-hour period
- **No rest**: Gain 1 fatigue level after 20 hours awake, then 1 additional level every 8 hours
- **Strenuous activity**: GM may impose fatigue for other exhausting activities

**Exhaustion Checks:**
When fatigue level exceeds  temporary wound levels, character becomes [[Exhaused]] getting -3 to all checks. After the end of the scene or 1 hour whatever comes first make Focus checks:
- **DC**: Equal to current fatigue level
- **Frequency**: Each hour after threshold, or after each scene (whichever comes first)
- **Failure**: Character falls unconscious

**Recovery:**
- **Full rest (8 hours)**: Remove 1 fatigue level
- **Poor conditions** (sleeping in wilderness, uncomfortable conditions): Requires more time, up to GM.

**Effects:**
- Each fatigue level removes 1 row of temporary wounds from maximum HP
- 1 temporary wound remains "locked" (unrecoverable) per fatigue level
- No other penalties - maintains "hero overcomes exhaustion" feel
