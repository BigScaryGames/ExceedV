### Shield Mastery 
#### **Shield Proficiency** (3 points)

You learn to effectively wield shields in combat. Shields add their bonus to your Defense Class calculation: **DC = [highest of Focus/Shield Bonus/Weapon Skill] + Control**. You gain access to the [[Shield Block]] reaction, and access to other Shield Feats.

**Shield Wall** (Passive): Adjacent allies gain +1 DC while you're wielding a raised shield. Enemies can't tumble through your space.


**Aegis** (Reaction): When an adjacent ally is targeted by an attack, you can intercept it using Shield Block Reaction.

**SpellGuard** (Passive, Limit 1)- Requirement: You are holding a magical shield. Add Shield's bonus to rolls against Line, Cone, Burst, Ray type of spells. 

**Shield Slam** (Action, Attack): Attack with your shield using Power + Shield Bonus. On hit, deal shield bonus as damage and push enemy back 1 square. (Might be OP, as attacks from power, but damage is 1-5 late game,so should be fine)

**Guardian Stance** (Passive): If you haven't moved more than half your movement from last turn, you and adjacent allies gain +2 DC.

**Guardian's Rush**(Attack, 2 actions) Req: (Shield Slam, Guardian stance) You run up to your movement and make a Shield Slam Attack. This movement doesn't stop
