## Description
Everyone wants to bend reality to their will. Unlike most you can, because you are a *mage*. 
During an important event in your life, your talent awoken. You might have been a child lost in the darkness who summoned light or adapted own eyes to see in it, a pilgrim who's legs were tired that you just wanted your backpack to become weightless, or you saw your loved ones dying and willed their wounds to stop bleeding. 


## Mechanics
* Select a Tier 0 spell. Add it to your repertoire. Don't add bonus to attributes from it. 
* You unlock Tier 0 spells to be able to add them to your repertoire.
* You can learn Team Ritual in one day provided written guidance or an hour provided a help of someone who knows it. This is highly common knowledge.
