# Armour

Defence Modifier: Armour doesn't provide a Defence Modifier to Defence Class(DC), but provides ablative armour that gives extra stress and raises the threshold for levels of injuries. Shields provide both AC and armour benefits.

**DC = [highest of Control/Shield/WeaponSkill] + Control + WeaponDefenseBonus**  
Armour restricts the maximum Control value that can be applied. More expensive armour being less demanding, higher Defence armour usually requiring more Power/Limit to wear.
