# Actions In Combat

After the initiative is rolled, players and NPCs act according to it.
At the beginning of the turn combatant gets their actions and reactions refreshed.

## Basic Actions (* represents the number of actions)

**Striking** - Striking normally takes * to attack, you can make a step forward as part of the strike.  
Second and further strikes per turn take 1FP, unless you have the appropriate Advantages/Perks.

**Move** - Actor moves for a number of squares equal to their speed. (Stand and step are move actions)  
**Rush** (1FP) - Move 1.5 distance  
**Step** - Actor moves one square without provoking reactions.

**Aggressive Attack** - actor makes an attack with +2 to hit and gets -2 to defence until the end of his next turn.

**Armour-up** (1SP) - regain temp-HP up to armour DR. (Armour-UP requires a reballance considering HT was added)

**All in Defence** (1SP) - Actor enters a defensive stance, increasing DR by 2 until the start of the next turn, and "Armours-up".

**Interact with Environment** - General interaction with objects/environment

**Push the body and mind** - (Once per combat) convert your MP/SP for up to Focus/HT mod.

**Jump** - run for up to your movement and leap.  
**Draw Weapon** - You draw your weapon.

**Aim** - reduce distance penalty up to "aim N" number.

## Free Actions

**Drop item** - You can drop items as a free action.  
**Speak** - speaking is a free action up to 10 words, unless you are casting a verbal spell at the same turn, which limits you to three words. (e.g. RUN YOU FOOLS after "You Shall Not Pass" spell)

## Reactions

**Jump to the side** (You are getting attacked by a ranged or AOE attack.) - You try to avoid an area of effect or ranged effect and get +2 to DC as you jump to the nearby square, and get **prone.**  
**Surrender** - you raise your hands to the mercy of the enemy instead of a defence, if the enemy proceeds, you get -4 to the DC against incapacitating (non-damaging) attacks.

## Conditions

**Stunned** - Character loses 1 action at the beginning of the next turn and cannot use reactions.

**Flanked** - Reduces DC (defence class) by the number of creatures flanking aside from the attacker. (thus easier DR bypassing)

**[[Prone]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]

## Combat Stances and Feats

Combat Prowess comes from Attributes and Weapon Skill. At the beginning of combat, you select a fighting style stance, up to your Limit from both Attribute Feats and Weapon Feats. Feats that don't have an attached Limit can be used regardless.
