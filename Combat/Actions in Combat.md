# Core REWRITE
Reactions shouldn't be present in the game. Instead use passive gameplay effects with no player choice.
e.g. autoactivation.



## Basic Actions (2 actions per turn)

**Attack**: Make a melee or ranged attack against a target
**Move**: Move up to your Speed in squares
**Aim**: Extend effective range for ranged weapons (see Ranged Combat)
**Step**: Move 1 square without provoking reactions
**Aggressive Attack**: Attack in melee with +2 to hit, -2 to DC until next turn
**Interact**: Use objects, open doors, etc.
**Draw/Sheathe Weapon**: Equip or put away equipment
Stand-Up and move: You can stand up and move half your movement as an action 
## Free Actions

**Drop Item**: Release held objects
**Speak**: Up to 10 words (3 if casting verbal spell)
**Surrender** (no trigger required, can be played outside your turn) - you raise your hands to the mercy of the enemy instead of a defense, if the enemy proceeds, you get -4 to the DC against incapacitating (non-damaging) attacks.

## Reactions (1 per turn)

**Jump Aside**: When targeted by ranged/area attack, gain +2 DC and move 1 square, become prone
