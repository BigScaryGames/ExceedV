## Attacking

**Attack Modifier** = Control + Weapon skill.  

#### Attacking Multiple Times Per Turn
**Second attack penalty**. Making second and further attacks with same hand provide -2 penalty to the attacks. 
**Two-Handed Weapons**: Weapons wielded in both hands count as attacks from the same hand for penalty purposes. 

#### Damage Calculation
Damage = Weapon Damage+Power+Weapon Skill+Ability bonuses
