**Concealed**: Weapon provides a +2 bonus to Spy checks to hide it on your person, and is undetectable without inspection.

##  #Ranged_Weapons(WIP)

**Note**: Bow damage varies based on Power requirements. An unfit bow (one in which you lack power) will have a minus to hit equal to Power-Power.req, 
a fit or lower power req. bow one will do extra damage equal to it's Power requirement. 

Range Increment - For weapons without the Aim trait (such as thrown weapons), range increments are equal to the weapon's Range value. For weapons with Aim X trait Range Increment = X.

| Weapon   | DMG         | Power Req | Properties             |
| -------- | ----------- | --------- | ---------------------- |
| Shortbow | 4+Power Req | -1 to 5   | Aim 10, Range 5,       |
| Longbow  | 5+Power Req | 0 to 5    | Aim 20, Large Range 2, |
