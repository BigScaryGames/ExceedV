## Attacking

**Attack Modifier** = Control + Weapon skill.  

**Second attack penalty**. Making second and further attacks with same hand provide -2 penalty to the attacks. 
**Two-Handed Weapons**: Weapons wielded in both hands count as attacks from the same hand for penalty purposes. 
**Agile Weapons:** are exempt of the second attack penalty.

Damage = Weapon Damage+Power+Weapon Skill 
## Weapon Traits
- **Thrown X**: Can throw the weapon up to X Squares without a range penalty.
- **Quick drawn**: Take out the weapon as part of the attack
- **Reach/Long reach**: can target 1-2/2-3 squares. If the weapon has both traits, it requires an action to switch the grip to change.
- **[[Heavy]]** - Weapon 
- **[[Large]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
- **[[Nonlethal]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
- **[[Conductive]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
