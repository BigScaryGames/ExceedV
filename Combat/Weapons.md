## Attacking

**Attack Modifier** = Control + Weapon skill.  

#### Attacking Multiple Times Per Turn
**Second attack penalty**. Making second and further attacks with same hand provide -2 penalty to the attacks. 
**Two-Handed Weapons**: Weapons wielded in both hands count as attacks from the same hand for penalty purposes. 

#### Damage Calculation
Damage = Weapon Damage+Power+Weapon Skill+Ability bonuses 
## Weapon Traits
- **Thrown X**: Can throw the weapon up to X Squares without a range penalty.
- **Quick drawn**: Take out the weapon as part of the attack
- **Reach/Long reach**: can target 1-2/2-3 squares. If the weapon has both traits, it requires an action to switch the grip to change.
- **[[Large]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
- **[[Nonlethal]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
- **[[Conductive]]** - [[PLACEHOLDER]]
* ***Agile** Weapons: are exempt of the second attack penalty.
* ***Heavy** weapons get -2 on second attack (regardless of hand)
* **Double** weapon: Counts as different hands for attack penalties"
