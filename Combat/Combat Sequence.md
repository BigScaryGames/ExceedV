## Initiative

### Determining Initiative:

- **Standard Encounters**: In most combat situations, initiative is determined by dice + Focus attribute. This reflects the character's mental preparedness, awareness, and reaction time when combat begins unexpectedly.
    
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles**: When a character initiates an ambush, you can use skills for a modifier instead.
    
- In case of a tie, Players go first.
    
- Spells, abilities, and circumstances provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
    
- Delaying is done before the beginning of one's turn to a predetermined point only once per round; all effects at the beginning and end of the turn are also delayed.
    

### Surprise rounds.

- In case of ambushers, roll initiative as one - the leader. This is to represent coordination during ambushes. All enemy combatants who get initiative 5 or lower than the leader of the ambush get stunned 1 (lose first action and cannot use reactions) as they try to figure out what to do.
