## Initiative

### Determining Initiative:

- **Standard Encounters**: In most combat situations, initiative is determined by dice + Focus attribute. This reflects the character's mental preparedness, awareness, and reaction time when combat begins unexpectedly.    
- **Ambushes or Prepared Battles**: When a character initiates an ambush, you can use skills for a modifier instead.
- In case of a tie, Players go first.    
- Spells, abilities, and circumstances provide bonuses to initiative rolls.
- Delaying is done before the beginning of one's turn to a predetermined point only once per round; all effects at the beginning and end of the turn are also delayed.

### Surprise rounds.

- Ambushers roll initiative as one - the leader. This is to represent coordination during ambushes. All enemy combatants who get initiative 5 or lower than the leader of the ambush get stunned 1 (lose first action and cannot use reactions) as they try to figure out what to do.

## Actions in Combat

At the beginning of your turn, you get 2 actions and 1 reaction. High attributes (3+) will provide extra actions that can be used according to the [[Attribute-Based Specialized Actions]] 
(To be developed, but as of now, in the test phase)

##  #Attack

**Attack  Modifier** = #Control + #Weapon_skill.  

#### Attacking Multiple Times Per Turn
**Consequent attack penalty**. Making second and further attacks with same hand provide -2 penalty to the attacks. 
**Two-Handed Weapons**: Weapons wielded in both hands count as attacks from the same hand for penalty purposes. 

#### Damage Calculation
Damage = Weapon Damage+Power+Weapon Skill+Bonuses 


### #Move
You can move using a move action.
